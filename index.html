			 <p>Thinking about how Micro.blog displays posts in the timeline and if there would be an advantage to excluding a category. Specifically, books as <a href="https://micro.blog/Annie">@Annie</a> now has me thinking about that but if I did that it would disrupts my flow of starting ALL posts in Obsidian as my main publishing tool now. 🤔</p>

			 <p>Decided to take advantage of this beautiful Minnesota weather today and put a <a href="https://strava.com/activities/13495413896">long run</a> in. The first two miles I was really second guessing my decision but then felt much better as more miles ticked by.</p>

			 <p>Let&rsquo;s just say it was a good run and test. I published a handful of posts about things I was finding out about it and honestly it is very slick if you are using Obsidian to quickly posts something online and it just works. I think one of the bigger downsides to me if someone wanted to use it as an actual blogging platform is that the RSS is really not great at all. I am sure there could be ways to get that to work better or you could spend the time curating something to work better there but that seems like more friction than I would want to do. Even though I didn&rsquo;t mention it earlier it is $8 per month if you pay for a year and that is kind of hefty in comparison to other blogging platforms you can find out there that are built more for well blogging. If you are looking for one I would check out one of the following</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>omg.lol</strong> - For $20 a year you get access to all the great <a href="https://home.omg.lol">omg.lol</a>apps which are worth much more than that in my option. From a blog perspective you can use Adam&rsquo;s weblog.lol that is part of the $20 per year. However, you you might want to hold off till Adam is done creating <a href="https://neato.pub">Neato</a> as it sounds well&hellip; Neato!</li>
<li><strong>micro.blog</strong> - There is a lot of apps you can get from Micro.blog depending on your subscription level. However, right now Manton has a new offering <a href="https://micro.one">micro.one</a> that is $1 per month blog which is an awesome price and way to get people blogging.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, between the RSS and honestly having too many blogging platforms that I pay for already (both above for starters) and don&rsquo;t always use I realized I didn&rsquo;t really need another place to just publish posts as I have worked so hard over the years trying to <a href="2022/01/05/all-in-on.html">combine things in one place</a>. So that is probably the biggest reason for ending the experiment.</p>
<p>However, with that said I did jump back into weblog.lol again as I wanted to see if I could get Obsidian synced up to make it easy to post there as I do with Micro.blog today. Once I get the setup I feel good about I will share that setup next, however, I get it might be all for nothing once everything gets switched to Neato but that is OK, it helped me focus on something else this past week.</p>

I checked each of them out and am now following 5 new people and it will be interesting to see what each ends up doing with their blog going forward.</p>

			 <p>I was doing my yearly backup of my Micro.blog site as well as other things I have online just to pull them down and store them on my local storage. As I was curious about what was in the zip file, I was reminded that all of the posts are in Markdown, and then I got this crazy idea: why not just load all these Micro.blog Markdown files into my Obsidian vault? Mostly because for almost the last 10 months, I have been using Obsidian for the start of all my posts and then publishing them using <a href="https://micropublish.blog/">Micro.Publish</a>. So I decided to do exactly that, and now I have a full backup in Obsidian, which is really nice.</p>
<p>Honestly, it was too easy to just get everything in here, and in the Properties part of the file, it had everything I really would need in order to make changes locally and use Micro.Publish to update old posts as part of my blog gardening from time to time. Well, it was all there, but some of the information needed to be modified. Seeing how I didn&rsquo;t want to go to each file and update things, I turned to my friend AI to assist in this process and create a Python script to do all the work for me. This is where AI really shines, as I figured out what I needed the end results to look like and then just asked with an example of what it is now and what it needs to look like. More specifically, the changes I wanted to make in each file were as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>create a &ldquo;permalink&rdquo; property based off of the url: one but remove the .html at the end</li>
<li>for the &ldquo;url&rdquo; property append <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog">ericmwalk.blog</a> before it so it would actually link to my blog (this is needed to have Micro.Publish update the right file)</li>
<li>Replace the Categories property with Tag</li>
<li>Add a &ldquo;title&rdquo; property for anything that doesn&rsquo;t have a title and leave it blank</li>
<li>Add a Publish property with the default setting of &ldquo;false&rdquo; as this is something that tells Obsidian Publish (if you are thinking of using that ever) if you want it published or not.</li>
<li>Remove all other properties that are not needed for the file to be able to be published again (e.g., images, photos, lastmod, guid, post_id)
<ul>
<li><em>Now maybe some of those things could come in handy at some point in the future but my reason for removing them is if I use Obsidian as my soruce of truth now these things do not get published or matter if I change them if I am updating the file.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reorder the Properties to just make it more pleastnt to my eyes in the following order: Title, Publish, Date, Tags, Permalink, and URL</li>
</ol>
<p>The good thing is AI was able to do all of this heavy lifting for me and fix the files as described above. I appreciate how it took a tedious task that I could have done to each file and just based on my trial and error of getting the right output (~20 min), I was able to get something that went through all the files and the properties section is how I want it.</p>
<p>The only downside of my overall approach is that I did it in 3 steps mostly because I didn’t want to start back over, and I realized after a couple of things changed, I wanted more as well as cleaning up some of the properties section. The end results were these three files below if anyone else wants to give it a go, but I would probably test small if you are actually going to use them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Steps 1-5 <a href="https://paste.lol/ericmwalk/mb_obsidian_update_properties">Micro.blog File Edit for Obsidian - Update Properties</a></li>
<li>Step 6: <a href="https://ericmwalk.paste.lol/mb_obsidian_remove_properties">Micro.blog File Edit for Obsidian - Remove Unused Properties</a></li>
<li>Step 7: <a href="https://home.omg.lol/address/ericmwalk/pastebin/mb_obsidian_reorder_properties">Micro.blog File Edit - Reorder Properties for Personal Preference</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Maybe if I have time at some point I will put it all in one file but the first one is really the most important in my opinion. I am also wondering if about making folders only by month instead of month and day as I typically don&rsquo;t post more than 1x per day anyways. So I might need another script to help with this lifting next.</em></p>

			 <p>It seems as though <a href="https://social.lol/@jason">Jason</a> has challenged me to do some work this weekend and answer questions. 🫠</p>
<h3 id="why-did-you-start-blogging-in-the-first-place">Why did you start blogging in the first place?</h3>
<p>This is a great question and I don&rsquo;t have a great answer. I know I dabbled back in my High School days of just writing silly things and posting it to a static webpage with just straight HTML. So that would have been at least back in 1998 since I worked at an Internet Service Provider with a good friend of mine. I probably kept doing that off and on then even though college as I have recolections of sites and that is where my Brebs.net domain came from (probably more on that another time). However, I would say actually documented in a CMS kind of blogging software started in 2007 when my wife and I went to Peru we documented out travels and then we started another one up the months before our first was born in 2009. However, you will see this blog really only goes back to 2011 when I started doing one just more for myself again. Also, I don&rsquo;t really have anything prior to 2007 online either but I do have the Travels and Family one still online that reminds me of another project that I want to do something with them at some point.</p>
<h3 id="what-platform-are-you-using-to-manage-your-blog-and-why-do-you-use-it">What platform are you using to manage your blog, and why do you use it?</h3>
<p>Everything is in Micro.blog for me at this moment and no real plans to change. I have tinkered with some other platforms since going <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2022/01/05/all-in-on.html">all in on Micro.blog</a> in January of 2022 but this platform fits my needs of having short posts to document things I am thinking about as well as longer form ones as well. I appreciate the work that Manton has done so far and I know he keeps making it better and adding features from time to time.</p>
<h3 id="have-you-blogged-on-other-platforms-before">Have you blogged on other platforms before? </h3>
<p>Of course I have&hellip; Seems like a silly question as I would like to find the one person that has been blogging for longer than a decade that has used the same platform since they originally started. I am going to include in here some of the places I have trialed as well but just didn&rsquo;t stick but I was more curious. So here is the list:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a></li>
<li>Blogger</li>
<li>WordPress at Wordpress.com</li>
<li>WordPress Self Hosted</li>
<li><a href="https://home.omg.lol">Weblog.lol</a></li>
<li><a href="https://pika.page/">Pika.Page</a>^</li>
<li><a href="https://scribbles.page/">Scribbles</a>^</li>
<li><a href="https://obsidian.md/publish">Obsidian.Publish</a>^</li>
<li><a href="https://public.me">Public.Me</a>^</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Honestly now that I typed these out I feel like there is probably others that I am just not remembering that I gave a try. However, that have been more short lived or that I am justing giving a try to for fun I noted with a ^.</em></p>
<h3 id="how-do-you-write-your-posts">How do you write your posts?</h3>
<p>Everything now starts in Obsidian and gets published to Micro.blog from obsidian. The nice thing is since pulling all my posts down into Obsidian I can go back and edit everything in there too and using Micro.Publish plugin it is super simple to post and update anything.</p>
<h3 id="whats-your-favorite-post-on-your-blog">What’s your favorite post on your blog?</h3>
<p>I think my personal favorite is the one where I documented running a <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/09/30/k-a-day.html">5k a day for 365 days</a>. It is mostly two fold because on the one had it was for me to just document what I did and my own accomplishment as that is really what I like about a blog is a good way to document things. The second is I did get a lot of feedback about it and in fact connected me with a conversation on a Podcast with two guys talking about running and one of which I still chat with from time to time today. The is the second part of Blogging that is amazing is that it does connect you with people you might have not run across in your normal day to day life and makes the world feel that much smaller.</p>
<h3 id="any-future-plans-for-the-blog">Any future plans for the blog?</h3>
<p>I have no real plans at this time as I like the current setup and it is working pretty well. I have been thinking about putting all my images on <a href="https://bunny.net">Bunny</a> to have them hosted from there but for now I think having everything on Micro.blog works perfectly for what I want.</p>
<h3 id="who-will-participate-next">Who will participate next?</h3>
<p>I would like to hear from <a href="https://schoonens.social/@camiel">Camiel</a> and <a href="https://micro.blog/darby3">Darby</a></p>

			 <p>It is about time as it seems like everyone else is doing a 2024 update to the <em>Dual of the Defaults</em> so I figured I would get it in right under the wire. Again a big shout out to <a href="https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097">Hemispheric Views and their Episode 097</a> when this idea was hatched and to <a href="https://rknight.me/app-defaults/">Robb</a> who is still keeping track of all of this.</p>
<p>So onto the 2024 list and lets see what has changed (<a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2023/11/06/application-defaults.html">2023 List</a>)&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>✉️ <strong>Mail Client</strong>: Apple Mail</li>
<li>📨 <strong>Mail Server</strong>: GoogleSuite &amp; Apple Mail</li>
<li>📝 <strong>Notes</strong>: Apple Notes (plus Obsidian plus GoodNotes for Work) - <em>Change</em></li>
<li>✅ <strong>To-Do</strong>: Reminders</li>
<li>📷 <strong>iPhone Photo Shooting</strong>: Camera.app</li>
<li>📚 <strong>Photo Management</strong>: Photos.app</li>
<li>🗓️ <strong>Calendar</strong>: Calendar.app</li>
<li>🗄️ <strong>Cloud file storage</strong>: iCloud and Google Drive (still a mess but getting better)</li>
<li>📰 <strong>RSS</strong>: Reeder with FreshRSS</li>
<li>📇 <strong>Contacts</strong>: Contacts.app (Google Backend)</li>
<li>🕸️ <strong>Browser</strong>: Safari (plus Chrome for Work)</li>
<li>💬 <strong>Chat</strong>: iMessage and Discord</li>
<li>🔖 <strong>Bookmarks</strong>: LinkAce - <em>Change (also I blame Robb for this)</em></li>
<li>👓 <strong>Read It Later</strong>:  <em>Not using anything at the moment</em></li>
<li>📜 <strong>Word Processing</strong>: Google Docs</li>
<li>📊 <strong>Spreadsheets</strong>: Google Sheets (plus Excel for Work)</li>
<li>🛝 <strong>Presentations</strong>: Google Slides</li>
<li>🛒 <strong>Shopping Lists</strong>: Alexa Lists 😱</li>
<li>🧑‍🍳 <strong>Meal Planning</strong>: <em>None</em> - Based on what I buy we cook 🤷‍♂️</li>
<li>💰 <strong>Budgeting &amp; Personal Finance</strong>: Copilot - <em>Change</em></li>
<li>🗞️ <strong>News</strong>: Apple News and various sources in RSS</li>
<li>🎶 <strong>Music</strong>: Apple Music</li>
<li>🎧 <strong>Podcasts</strong>: PocketCasts</li>
<li>🔐<strong>Password Management:</strong> iCloud KeyChain <em>(Not a change but found my old KeePass file as it had some things on it I needed for my kids over break. So it is kind of in use right now as I need to migrate that in 2025 to something better.)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>So overall I have had 3 changes of which my note taking apps I feel like change all of the time so that is really hard to count. So in other things I think the most sinificant is the other two as my wife and I have settled in on Copilot and have enjoyed using it for basic finance tracking. Also, even though I kind of did it on a whim and figured I would go back to Shaarli I have been enjoying using LinkAce for bookmarking. I think my only issue is every time it says there is an upgrade I forget how to do it. However, now that I think about it, it was the same for Shaarli too.</p>

			 <p>Once I had created the template so I could get a better way to have things display on my Obsidian Publish site I next zeroed in on how to quickly create a note in the right place using the format I created. Because a I do make a lot of quick posts in my real blogging/journaling setup so it would be nice to put it in the right place in the right format that can just be tweaked sligtly to allow for multiple entries. That is where a previously installed plugin called  <a href="https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes">Periodic Notes</a> helped solve this. I gave this plugin a try earlier when using it for weekly notes but I never really used it so I just sat. However, I realized that how I configured that I could use their Daily Notes portion to modify it as you see below to have a new file created in the right place and then using the template I created it would have the right structure to show up on my site correctly.</p>

<p>This really does seem to give some promise to the overall using Obsidian to create online posts quickly if or at least if anything in a place they might want after a structure is created. I will say even if/once I abandon this little project with Obsidian Publish I might have to start using this Daily Notes plugin as all of my <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/categories/running/">Running</a> posts on Micro.blog have started in Obsidian since May of 2024. I have just found it easier for me to write there and then using <a href="https://github.com/otaviocc/obsidian-microblog">Micro.Publish</a> (also using <a href="https://heydingus.net/shortcuts/microblog-multimedia-uploader">Multimedia Uploader</a>to get the picture I take with it) get it to get it posted to my site with no distractions.</p>

			 <p>The more I have been using Obsidian as part of trying out Obsidian Publish, I actually think it could fit even more of just my everyday workflow and quite possibly replace how I use DayOne today. I primarily use DayOne as a notebook to capture a lot of different things, thoughts, notes, places, and things my kids have made or done. I guess as DayOnes purpose it is a digital journal that keeps both public things from my <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog">micro.blog</a> site as well as personal things or things I just don&rsquo;t share. One of my favorite things about DayOne that currently can not easilsy be replaced in Obsidian is the ability to capture location data when a note is created or it is updated when you add a photo. I have seen some articles and support pages having this as a request but I haven&rsquo;t really found anything that will work that is just using a simple plugin. I think if Obsidian had a plugins that did this well or location data was built into the main program I would have to take an even closer look to just have Obsidian and cut out other note taking apps.</p>

			 <p>Go figure my first time ever making a Template in Obsidian is when I decided to go a little further in this Obsidian Publish and figured out a way to &ldquo;automate&rdquo; some features as well as help keep things organized. So this is what I have come up with so far.</p>
<pre><code>---
permalink: {{date:YYYY}}/{{date:MM}}/{{date:DD}}/post-title
tags: 
date: {{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}
publish: &quot;false&quot;

<p><em>The permalink feature is really nice as this also helped solve a problem I had where I had to keep everything in the Vault root. Now as long as you are going to use Permalinks you can kind of put it anywhere.</em></p>

			 <p>Now that I pretty much have a working example of Obsidian Publish going and have changed around some of the settings and CSS even to make it look like it is right now here are my initial thoughts:</p>
<h3 id="-plus">+ Plus</h3>
<ul>
<li>I actually really like having this right inside where I have been taking notes and other things that I can quickly publish something from that images and all with no fuss, the note just shows up online.</li>
<li>You are able to point your own domain or subdomain to Obsidian Publish. I did it the easy way by using Cloudflare since that was their example as I couldn&rsquo;t quickly tell the easiest path with my own provider but I am sure there is a way. Seems to work fine with the Free version of Cloudflare so no issues.</li>
<li>Customize the look and feel, I just left it as default right away and they have a couple simple things you can change right in the Obsidian Publish screen. There is more advanced ways to do it as well modifying CSS and after I gave it a go I did start searching GITHub and found a handful of sites that published their CSS as a good example to follow and use. Ultimatly, after all of my work creating my own publish.css I then found <a href="https://minimal.guide/publish/download">Minimal.Guide</a> had a good simple example of a Dracula theme <em>(and others)</em> I wish I would have found earlier.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="--minus">- Minus</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lack of RSS support, yes there is an RSS link for this site but there is not really any of the information you would want like date another things. It is really just a breakdown of note titles from what I can tell.</li>
<li>You have to keep it in the root of your Obsidian Vault, or if you don&rsquo;t you will leave you website pointing to /folder/notes. This would not be a huge deal if I used this whole Vault for just my Obsidian Publish site but the benefits I would enjoy keeping is being able to just have all things in one spot and then one Folder that was really a mirror of my site which I can move things in and out of. There is some chatter about in in the <a href="https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-publish-set-sub-folder-as-site-root/64272">Forum</a> so maybe this will change someday but I get why it probably is the way it is right now.</li>
<li>Modify the CSS of the site is possible by use of the <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian+Publish/Customize+your+site">publish.css</a> file you need to create in the root of your site, but you can&rsquo;t edit it in Obsidian. So you it is burried in your vault system folder and you have to modify it there but then still go though the publish commands in obsidian to get it updated. Slightly clunky when you are testing things out but after you get it set I understand how then it is just in the background.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are a couple of Sites using Obsidian Publish I stumbled upon as I was figuring things out and they also have their publish.css and publish.js on GitHub:</p>

			 <p>Flooding Complete: 27 hrs and 11,649 Gallons (44,096 L) of water later I am now going to call it good. It really did take much longer than when I did it in <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2022/12/07/flooding-complete-a.html">2022</a> but I used less water overall and the rink size of 54' x 32' is the same.

			 <p>18 years and counting! It’s hard to believe how time flies, and true to form, we’re spending the evening running kids to their activities. We’ll hold off and celebrate when things calm down later this week, but for now, Happy Anniversary! So grateful to have my amazing wife by my side to navigate through it all.</p>

			 <p>Since the update that happend this last week my Siri has failed to work and I could not figure out why for the longest time. I should preface that I have Apple Intelligence running as well. Everytime I would try to ask it to do something it would quick flash and go away.</p>
<p>As it frustrating has not worked all week I have realized how many times I ask it to do simple things like text, open apps and what not. As I thought about it when I saw this message and captured it I got the feeling this probably was the culprit.
<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2024/img-0319.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Using that as my guide I did some digging on the interwebs as I had some time during the swim meet this morning. Thankfully I found some help on the <a href="https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/764149">Apple Developer forum</a> as it seems like others have had a similar problem. This last comment I did exactly this and it worked.</p>

			 <p>Such a fun event and another <a href="https://strava.com/activities/12637582207">Trout Brook 10 Mile</a>  run in the <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2023/10/07/trout-brook-ten.html">books</a> at Willow River State Park in Wisconsin. Couldn’t have had better weather as not as cool as last year but just perfect short and short weather. Glad it was cooler as I took my water bottles along thinking I would take one just incase on the run only to find out I forgot the belt it goes with. Since I didn’t want to carry it I decided to just wing it as that was what this whole tail run was anyways. </p>
<p>I ended up running it faster than last year though I think this route was more challenging. With more up and downs on single track trails. Which comes to find out I am not good at in a race.  Hence in the first two miles I took a little fall in order to take a souvenir home after the run on my knees. Even despite the fall and hills I probably could (should) have pushed it harder on some up hills to stick to the two leaders as after the stairs and the turn around I never saw them again and was really by myself till the end of the race to take <a href="https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=111355">3rd overall</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2024/img-0370.jpeg" alt="A scenic view of a lush forest landscape surrounding a winding river under a cloudy sky."></p>
<p>It was also great that I did talked an old work friend the one and only Joey Metzger to join last min this week. So it was great catching up with him before. </p>

<p><em>I guess I could still not stop and take pictures in a race. That might help as well but.. it was just so nice out which also could be why I fell as I was not watching my feet and looking around.</em></p>

			 <p>Just my luck that it happened to be full sun when I decided to head out for a <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/12424847752">run</a> today. It really felt like work today getting these miles in. The DewMe.app gave the run a RunFeel™ of &ldquo;oppressive 🥵&rdquo; which I am not going to disagree with.</p>

			 <p>Wet tracks and trails was the theme of this rambling <a href="https://strava.com/activities/12409883729">run</a> while my son and his friends golfed at a nearby course. It was a good way to pass the Saturday morning as I explored a lot of little places I had not been even in very familiar places.</p>

			 <p>Fun <a href="https://strava.com/activities/12403683527">run</a> checking out the new hiking trails around Braemar. Not going to lie I liked the old ones better but I am sure over time these might grow on me.

			 <p>I was doing some blog gardening today and stumbled across a picture I took when <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2017/08/28/was-a-great.html">hiking to Estes Cone back in 2017</a> with my wife. We were out there for a wedding, and my good friend was telling us it was a &ldquo;casual&rdquo; walk, to which my wife didn’t agree after we got back that night. Anyway, as I was doing my usual cleanup, I realized it would be great to find my Strava activity from that day, as I was almost 100% certain I had it from back then, which I did, using a Fitbit Surge. 😱</p>
<p>The problem was that the hike got split into two files: a 4 mile section and a 2 mile section, either due to user or watch error, as I can’t remember now. So, wanting to clean things up, I figured it would be great if I could combine these files and make one entry to link to on my blog from this post.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://gotoes.org/strava/">GOTOES</a>, the web based app that can track repair, merge, and edit GPS files. Honestly, it was as simple as that. I downloaded both of my original GPS files from Strava, deleted those Strava activities (if you don’t do that, when you try to upload the new file, it will say it’s a duplicate), used the <a href="https://gotoes.org/gotoes/strava/Combine_GPX_TCX_FIT_Files.php">Combine / Repair FIT, GPX, or TCX Files</a> app from GOTOES to export a file that combined both of those activities, then uploaded it back to Strava to have a nice new combined activity that I could link to in my post to check out years down the road.</p>
<p>This is the second time I’ve really used these tools. Another time, my GPS got all out of sorts, and somehow these tools made sense of the corrupted data so it would show up in Strava with the correct map and data. Even after that first time, I saw the value here, so even though it’s only a couple of times a year that I use it, I donated to the cause. I really enjoy finding these tools that people spent time creating, even though it’s free, and I probably don’t need the enhanced features. But I want to see it stick around, and obviously, the person took time in building them for my benefit.</p>

			 <p>The weather seemed too good today to pass up a <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/11914701064">run</a> after work. The weather was ok but I wasn’t feeling 100% and tried to find a couple hills along the way as I think my lack of miles lately is translating to lack of elevation gains.</p>

			 <p>Early <a href="https://strava.com/activities/11901532104">run</a> today was the plan to get some cooler weather. Today was one of those days I decided to add some miles but even when I finished I thought I had run 1 mile less but still was happy. Then I looked closer and realized I matched last weeks mid week long run.</p>

			 <p>I guess the sign was actually correct today by saying the Trail was underwater. By the time I <a href="https://strava.com/activities/11753788700">ran</a> across the sign and then into this bypass I was of at a path of no return in having to backtrack quite a bit. Normally I would power though and just get my feet soaked but i decided against it today.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2024/05/28/json-to-rss.html">JSON to RSS for Micro.blog</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2024/05/28/json-to-rss.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-05-28 20:48:09 -0600">May 28, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This started out long ago from a post I saw from Sven Dahlstrand (<a href="https://micro.blog/sod">@sod</a>) where he had posted or replied to a post that he created a JSON feed that included at the bottom of each post where you could <a href="https://micro.blog.via.dahlstrand.net/">reply in Micro.blog</a>. This was a great news for me as I got to the point where I like to catch up every now and then on what is going on in my Timeline of Micro.blog but with out some sort of sync I wanted everything to just live in my RSS reader of choice. However, I was quickly sad that my current RSS process / application (<em>FreshRSS</em>) did not support JSON feeds.</p>
<p>So I turned to searching various rabbit holes on the internet until I found what I was looking for where you could hardcode a JSON feed into a PHP script (<em>note you have to have this running on your own server</em>) and then it would give me back a RSS feed. This was a great start and I appreciate all the help I found from the Dave Jones and his <a href="https://gist.github.com/daveajones/be26f5ca9cb7559d0c33549b53323770">jsonfeed2rss.php</a> script. However, it was missing the crucial part I now wanted thanks to Sven where I could actually click on some sort of link and get back to the Micro.blog post where I could leave a reply.</p>
<p>So I went to hacking together from what I could figure out how to get an JSON feed from Micro.blog to somehow give me a link to where I could get back and leave a reply if I wanted. I was able to figure it out and have been running that v1.0 since back in March 2023. The only downside was that I was hardcoding my username in the script so I couldn&rsquo;t really share anything out at that point. Also, I found out the discovery feed was a JSON feed too but I couldn&rsquo;t quite figure out how to get that to work either.</p>
<p>So I finally took the time to get the Discovery Feed to work not only the main one but also the emoji specific searches. However, I was still kind of stuck at using multiple copies of the script as I was still hard coding it. Easy enough solution, more digging and figuring out how to easily <strong>hack</strong>* together a passthrough so if anyone wanted to use it they could by just including the old get at the end of a link.</p>
<p>The only catch is you have to have the PHP script on a web server somewhere. If you are interested or find yourself in need of a JSON to RSS script links to both version are below. Also, the list to find available Micro.blog RSS and JSON feeds is included as well.</p>

<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/ericmwalk/c82cf3f0f2ac83ec82f2e7520e8149df">v2.0 GitHub - Same as above but on GitHub 🤷‍♂️</a></li>

			 <p>Something I didn&rsquo;t do when I decided to run a <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/09/30/k-a-day.html">5k a day</a> was talk about or even mention it. Thinking back I believe I told only one person over coffee one morning. 😉</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Taking a step back, my goal was at first a week, then a month, then a couple of months but I never was thinking 1 year being the goal.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, it was never a goal when I started so maybe that is why I didn&rsquo;t but I know at some point I got it stuck in my brain and I could have talked about it.</p>
<p>So 100 days of what, well 100 days of not having a drink of an alcoholic beverage. I should be clear on the why this is interesting and I am talking about it. Honestly, it is nothing special or big grand reason as to why, I just told myself I am going to give it a try and that is what I am doing. I have been building up some millage running and I guess part of me wanted to see if it would change how I felt or recovered during the week or after long runs. So 100+ days this is my current take aways both from a good or just interesting perspective from my own personal experience (in no order):</p>
<ul>
<li>I noticed about 1 month into this I was very tired and exhausted, I don&rsquo;t know if it attributed to this but I had a stretch that I was just tired for a good week or so straight almost like my body didn&rsquo;t know what to do without. I won&rsquo;t say I was addicted but I do wonder if like taking a week off of coffee (caffeine) sometimes you can get headaches.</li>
<li>I think from my fitness perspective it has made my longer runs 100% easier and possibly a faster recovery after the fact.</li>
<li>I have dropped 10 lbs from where I was hovering in all of 2023. Some of this I have changed some eating habits but I do wonder if that habit has been easier by not having some extra endless calories from time to time.</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess I didn&rsquo;t really touch on has it been hard ever, the answer to this is yes in fact. As I made the decision to just step away for a little while I was very cognizant that I had a week of business travel where we were with our consultants and had many dinners out. I don&rsquo;t mind not having a drink but sometimes I think if the server came to me first as I was a more seniored person at the table most of the time I set the tone of not getting a drink and then everyone else followed. There was also a parent Hockey party that I feel like 100% of the time involves drinking so I did get a handful of questions as to <em>why</em> I wasn&rsquo;t drinking anything. No one really cares but it is something to note that people do notice and you 1000% will get a question. This also was noticed but not really asked as we celebrated my birthday a while back and went out to eat with my parents. Finally, I have noticed as time as gone on and further reflection, I have kind of avoid the easy pitfall places like hockey &ldquo;safety meetings&rdquo; or catching up with someone after work for a drink. Both of those places I know I do not have to drink so it isn’t that at all. I think some of with this current habit change and seeing it though for a while it was easier to avoid them. I need to get this part out of my head though as I still need to be social with friends and colleagues if this experiment continues.</p>
<p>So that is all I have for now and as I sit over 100 days I am not going to say I might stop today or continue for another 5, 50, or 100 days. Just a reflection point for myself as it has been an interesting experiment.</p>
<p><em>This post has been sitting in my drafts since day 50 but it is well past that at this point. I think there is two reasons here: (1) I wrote it and was going to post it right away but got distracted and never really came back to it (2) I still was for some reason not sure about posting it out as I didn&rsquo;t and still don&rsquo;t have what that end goal is or if there is a reason to this experiment.</em></p>

			 <p>Running the other day I ran by the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Observatory">Portland Observatory</a> which is on my list to actual goto when it is open but I haven&rsquo;t had a chance as it isn&rsquo;t open year round.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2024/img-8882.jpeg" alt="A tall, red lighthouse stands against a cloudy sky, surrounded by residential buildings and parked vehicles."></p>
<p>I find older cities and towns fascinating as the town I live in doesn&rsquo;t have the same type of historical story or maybe more specifically not as many older buildings still being used today. Granted there is history where I live but not to the same extent as Portland, ME (or other places). There is so many buildings I see during my wandering around Portland that I wonder what it originally was used for and all of that just like the Portland <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2024/03/05/decided-to-hit.html">Hey Building</a> and <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2023/03/06/photoblogging-day-this.html">Portland Co. Pattern Storehouse</a> that I only breilfy wrote about before.</p>
<p>So when I saw the picture above on my flight home, I decided to spend some time with this wonderful Free High Speed Delta WiFi while watching movies to do a little digging about the <a href="https://www.portlandlandmarks.org/observatory">Portland Observatory</a>. This is the summary of what I found.</p>
<p>The tower was built in 1807 by sea captian who turned entrepreneur Captain Lemuel Moody. It was constructed in a remarkably short period of time (4 months from April to July) due to the simplicity of the observatory&rsquo;s design and the use of local materials and labor. Despite its quick construction, the observatory was a well-built and sturdy structure, able to withstand the harsh weather conditions of the Maine coast.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2024/166.png" alt="">
<em>Photo Copyright of <a href="https://www.mainememory.net/record/166">Maine Historical Society</a></em></p>
<p>It was a commercial venture to give ship owners a competitive edge if they paid  Moody a subscription fee of $5.00 a year to alert them when their ships were arriving. With a telescope at the top he could see incoming ships from as far as 30 miles away and then could hoist signal flags identifying the vessels coming in.</p>
<p>This signal tower also increased the efficiency of Portland Harbor and the Observatory remained a working marine signal tower run by the Moody family until 1923 when the invention of the two-way radio made it obsolete. </p>
<p>The original cost of constructing it was a mere $6000 in 1807 and during the peak of the observation towers services it generated an estimated $1,000 in revenue per year from these fees, demonstrating its importance and value to the maritime community.</p>
<p>In 1866, the observation tower actually survived the Great Fire which destroyed much of Portland. This helped solidify the observatory as a symbol of the city&rsquo;s resilience and determination to rebuild the town after the devastating fire.</p>
<p>The Portland Observatory is the only remaining historic maritime signal station in the United States. </p>

			 <p>For the past couple of posts I have made, everything has been written in Obsidian and then pushed to Micro.blog via <a href="https://micropublish.blog/">Micro.Publish</a> created by Otavio Cordeiro.</p>
<p>Not only have I used Obsidian to create and post those, they have mostly been done on my iPhone as well. I have also found that using Jarrod Blundy&rsquo;s wonderful iOS shortcut called <a href="https://heydingus.net/shortcuts/microblog-multimedia-uploader">Multimedia Uploader</a> to get pictures on my site is the perfect addition. I can then copy that link and put it in my Obsidian document, so I can finish any extra writing as necessary prior to hitting publish.</p>
<p>This new process has been working well, and I not only have been doing it for my longer posts as part of WeblogPoMo2024 but also on some of my shorter posts about runs and other random thoughts that would not come through my Status.lol.</p>
<p>Not sure if I will continue with this for the long haul, but right now, this has also renewed my want to use Obsidian as I can use it on my various devices. A great example is this specific post: I started it on MacOS, but I am finishing it up on the plane on my iPhone prior to takeoff.</p>

			 <p>I didn’t think much of it a couple weeks ago when I found a balloon sitting next to my office door in the backyard. However, a couple days later I saw another mostly deflated balloon in my side yard by where I take the dogs out. After that a day or two went by and yet I found another one blowing around in the backyard as it had my motion camera going crazy.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2024/img-8724.png" alt="A green balloon with a yellow ice cream icon rests on grass, casting a shadow.">
<em>Not really sure what that logo is.</em></p>
<p>Again I thought nothing of it but was starting to think it was very odd. Finally, I was taking out the trash one night and saw something moving slowly in the street towards my house. Yep another balloon.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2024/img-8723.png" alt="A green balloon rests on asphalt near a concrete curb under ambient light at night.">
<em>This was slightly disturbing as it slowly was moving towards my house in the street as I thought it was an animal.</em></p>
<p>Now this time it really got me thinking… <em><strong>Where do balloons go to deflate?</strong></em></p>
<p>It is actually a great question and had me wondering what happened to balloons that people let go of in the air on purpose or accident. I mean they have to go somewhere or deflate and end up in someones yard or in the trees. Come to think of it every year on my mother-in-laws birthday since she passed away we would have the kids write messages on balloons and let go of them in the air. Cute and fun I know but now I am worried what if someone every year got these random balloons that showed up in their yard talking about their Grandma Diana. I am wondering would those people have thought about it and then the consistency of when it would happen. As come to think about it we would do it on special occasions as well. However, now that the kids are older we don&rsquo;t do it as much or frequent so maybe those people are wondering what happened?</p>
<p>Lets just hope my house doesn’t become a constant balloon deflating ground as I don’t really want it to look like this.</p>

Honestly, it had an eerie sense to it like I was watching something on the show <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/95396">Severance</a>. This is a screenshot from my watch of what I saw:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2024/media.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I went my normal Apple expert route of bothering <a href="https://grepjason.sh">Jason Burk</a> with anything and everything I randomly want to know about my Apple products. I am pretty sure he appreciates all of the questions or Apple issue rants I send his way. However, this one stumped him and didn’t have an answer for me either so I went to internet searching.</p>
<p>Come to find out it is an Apple feature called <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iph1b6c664b7/ios">NameDrop</a>… Never heard of it 🤷‍♂️.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NameDrop (part of AirDrop) is an easy way for you to share your contact information with someone, or receive theirs, without handing them your iPhone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah, well that makes sense and actually now that I know what an interesting feature. I am sure it was talked about and I missed it but I think back to when my kids were younger and trying to exchange contact information with other parents (assuming they had iOS devices) this would have been super slick.</p>
<p>Still the one odd thing is you can activate it between your own devices which I would think it would know I don’t need my own contact information from my phone to my watch or vice versa.</p>
<p><em>I decided to capture a longer video below vs just the quick screenshot I took earlier.</em></p>

			 <p>I really do like my <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2022/09/23/might-be-time.html">Apple Ultra</a> watch and am glad to only be rocking one watch on a daily basis unlike a couple years ago. However, having the Ultra well over a year now and knowing the Apple Watch itself has been out so long I still can&rsquo;t believe that the missed opportunity to have a route mapping function on the watch with in the stock Workout app. Typically I don&rsquo;t need it often but when I map out some really long runs on my phone I have to pull it out from time to time to make sure I catch the right trail or street, two things I don&rsquo;t love doing when I am out running and also further makes me not want to run with out my phone.</p>
<p>Now, yes there are a couple apps out there that can allow you to get turn by turn directions but most are not great or require an additional subscription to use and I had found a hadful of them don&rsquo;t work that great or are complex to setup. Also, you run into the issue of are you going to run just that or the Workout app as well and how do you flip back and forth.</p>
<p>With all of that said and even with some of the limitations that are still there I was pointed in the direction of <a href="http://www.workoutdoors.net/">WorkOutDoors</a> app from <a href="https://micro.blog/mroutley">Mat Routley</a> which I have actually found to be a solid running map navigator. I have used it a handful of times now and been running the workout app at the same time but in the background. Flipping between them if I need to for any reason is a pain but I am getting used to it. However, my last longer run I started the Workoutdoor app then started my workout app and then went back to the workoutdoor app until about a mile or so left because I knew the direction. It didn&rsquo;t kill my battery for being out there for 2 hrs and 45 min of two GPS apps running and timing.</p>
<p>I had to buy this app but honestly I have no issues paying for an app that does what it says and it woeked better than others that wanted more of a subscription base. I will say this app has a lot of settings but I think that is what I like about this, check the settings you want on your phone, load the GPX map you want to follow or map it in the iOS app and go. Nothing to crazy just filling the gap that the WatchOS left in the Workout app. Maybe someday that will be corrected but for now I don&rsquo;t mid this setup and again it allows me on longer or more complex runs to leave my Garmin again at home.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Every now and then I run across something that has me remember something from my past and today it was a computer game called <strong><a href="http://www.bolo.net">Bolo</a></strong> by Stuart Cheshire. Don&rsquo;t be mistaken by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolo_(1982_video_game)">1982 game</a> that was for the Apple II as I am talking about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolo_(1987_video_game)">1987 game</a>.</p>
<p>I mean what wasn&rsquo;t there to like about this very basic game, you were a tank on an island for a winner or team take all. In the game you could capture <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillbox_(military)">pillboxes</a> (automatic gun turrets), refueling bases, build walls and boats, join alliances, farm trees, and lay mines. You could find other built maps or even create your own to add to the challenge if you wanted to play alone or even with others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Bolo is the Hindi word for communication. Bolo is about computers communicating on the network, and more importantly about humans communicating with each other, as they argue, negotiate, form alliances, agree strategies, etc.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To top if off if you were lucky enough you could play against others on a local network at your school which is what some of my friends and I did. It helped that this was back when Mac computers were starting to show up in school and my dad was the Middle School Principal so he would let a couple of us go into the computer labs after school. Most of the time there was only 2-4 of us so we would boot up as many computers as we could and set most of them to be on autopilot with various &ldquo;Brains&rdquo; we had downloaded to the disks we had.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2024/91f363d561.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>In my stumbling around to find out more about this old game I used to enjoy I found where you can play an old version online in the <a href="https://archive.org/details/BoloMacintosh">Internet Archive</a>.</em></p>

			 <p>Such a great book and as the title suggests it really is <strong>For You</strong>, now granted Patrick wrote it for a very specific <strong>You</strong> in mind but the words and wisdom in this book can be shared and internally reflected on by anyone.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2024/img-8674.jpeg" alt="A book titled &ldquo;For You&rdquo; by Patrick Rhone lies shut on a scratched surface, captured in black and white."></p>
<p>This is probably a book I should have read before now and then revisited every year as it is just a quick read. I can see this book being my reminder of the magic in our everyday connections and honestly how to think about and tackle things you might run across.</p>
<p>There is honestly so many bite sized quotes and phrases I could pull from this book but one I jotted down as it resonated with me in in the <strong>You Are A Result section</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You make choices and actions in this moment, right now, that will change you For better or the worse. It&rsquo;s your choice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just a perfect small reminder that depending where you are at in your life or thougths it grabs your attention and really makes you think. Maybe today is the day I should do something different because whatever happens in the future most likely could have an impact from today.</p>
<p>If you are wondering where to pick up this amazing book it is available now so go <a href="https://patrickrhone.com/for-you/">snag a copy</a> if you think this might be something that could be helpful as well. I am most likely going to get one as a gift for each of my kids for them to have and a a proper time. In addition, I am thinking I might pick up an extra one or two that I might drop off at a little library during my travels this year.</p>

To preface, working in all sorts of time zones are great to keep things moving in a smaller team. However, the days you wake up with 60+ unread emails in your inbox of which 95% are probably just calendar invitations (and corrections to times) and document shares you might become slightly frustrated. Today was that day for me and it broke the camel’s back as you would say. I was done with having those types of items cluttering all of the other normal emails that are mostly more time critical things to address or action in the morning for me. So I decided to do some digging tonight to see how best I could filter out these offending emails so I could get to what I wanted.</p>
<p>I was actually shocked that I found fairly quickly a filter I could create using the following:</p>
<p><code>subject:(&quot;invitation&quot; OR &quot;accepted&quot; OR &quot;rejected&quot; OR &quot;updated&quot; OR &quot;canceled event&quot; OR &quot;declined&quot; OR &quot;proposed&quot;) when where calendar who organizer</code></p>
<p>So I use that and dump them in a folder (still marked as unread but skipping the inbox) titled Meetings.</p>
<p>After that was accomplished rather quickly I turned to the Google Documents (Sheets, Slides, Docs) share issue. It isn&rsquo;t that I don&rsquo;t want to go though them but sometimes they clutter my inbox before I am ready to deal with them on a quick pass. So I took to searching again but this was not as fruitful as I couldn&rsquo;t find exactly what I wanted so I pieced this filter together by using common terms I kept noticing in the From field. The results are as follows:</p>
<p><code>From: &quot;(via Google Drive)&quot; OR &quot;(via Google Slides)&quot; OR &quot;(via Google Docs)&quot; OR &quot;(via Google Sheets)&quot;</code></p>
<p>Again, it isn&rsquo;t that I wanted them deleted or all marked unread for no reason so I just dump them into a Documents folder and I can dive into them later in my day.</p>
<p>In my search for the second example, I did find an easier way to do the first filtering method for calendar invites that was burried in the <a href="https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/11387073?sjid=7810924241319776005-NC&amp;visit_id=638489925966315276-713929201&amp;rd=1#filter_calendar&amp;zippy=%2Clearn-how">Google Workspace Learning Center</a> . I have pulled the relevant example below. I ended up changing mine to this as it seems a little cleaner and should address outside calendar items too.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Open <a href="https://mail.google.com/">Gmail</a>.</li>
<li>In the search box at the top, click Show search options</li>
<li>In the <strong>To</strong> field, enter your email address.</li>
<li>Next to <strong>Has the words</strong>, enter <strong>invite.ics OR invite.vcs</strong>.</li>
<li>Check the <strong>Has attachment</strong> box.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Create filter</strong>.</li>
<li>Check the <strong>Apply the label</strong> box and choose a label to automatically sort incoming event response messages.</li>
<li>Check the <strong>Skip the Inbox (Archive it)</strong> box to move response messages out of your inbox. Don’t worry, you can still view them later if needed.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Create filter</strong>.</li>
</ol>

			 <p>I was sad to see the news inside of the Shaarli IOS app that the IOS app will cease to exist starting sometime in the summer of 2024. I am not sure if this will really happen or not but I decided to search around to find an alternative for me to quickly send a link to my Shaarli instance. I found one that Mike Rockwell at <a href="https://initialcharge.net/projects/toolkit/">InitialCharge</a> had put together at some point but stated he no longer used anymore. I obviously tried to run it and it kind of worked but added a lot of extra characters in the Title and Link that I felt could be cleaned up. So I used what he started as an example to what I needed to do and started from scratch.</p>
<p>In the end, I put tougher a very basic example that works and I can see where I could make some improvements going forward but not sure I will do much at this time but more tried to prepare myself for the time that the IOS app might go away. The other nice thing is that this Shortcut I can use on my Mac too but obviously I can use the Bookmarklet as well so it is a little duplicative.</p>

			 <p>I am baffled by what has been happening as I <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2023/12/22/thanks-for-taking.html">posted in December</a> last year when I purchsed some picturs and was handed a USB stick. I am not quite sure what is happening that some companies resorting to sending (or giving) people pictures on USB sticks! Isn&rsquo;t this the age of highspeed internet, almost unlimited data, and cheap online storage? I thought this was long dead but to the point, I now have in my position two USB sticks from the same orginization that we purchased pictures from from our daughters dance competiation almost a month back. The first one that we recieved 2 weeks ago was corrupt so they had to mail us another one 🙄.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2024/img-8517.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>The best part is for people to <em>view</em> the pictures to let the company know what routines your daughters are in (by a number system) you log into SmugMug where they have all of these photos by routine. So then after they email you they load the routines on a USB stick, put them in the mail and hope for the best.</p>
<p>I am so confused on so many levels about what had happened.</p>
<p>On a positive, the pictures that they got of my daughter look really good! Also, I really can’t complain about the color of the USB sticks… 🧡</p>

			 <p>A little word of advice, but honestly it just seems like common knowledge&hellip;</p>
<p>If you are trying to set up what you deem as a very important meeting that needs to happen face to face and is urgent, I would expect some confirmation in return when I send you over a time that works based on the initinal email you sent that had big blocks of time. Maybe I should just assume that the time is going to work no matter what time I choose as I choose a time from your list but it makes me uneasy not getting a confirmation due to the fact that it seems of the utmost urgency.</p>
<p>So here I am wondering after 18 hours have passed with still no response and the meeting that requires me to leave work early, drive to a meeting with a very cryptic topic of discussions has me confused at how <strong>important</strong> this meeting is.</p>
<p><em>I should clarify that this <strong>imporant</strong> meeting is being requested about an activity my 9 year olds is doing. Yep, you read that right.</em></p>

			 <p>Well not really the return of the actual company or products but as I was looking at past blog posts today I found <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2011/03/30/my-first-post.html">My First Post that was posted on March 30, 2011</a> about an interesting Kickstarter called Record Monsters <em>(well that is as much as I had retained to this point)</em>. I probably would haven&rsquo;t backed it at all but back in the days of earlier Twitter one of the creators <a href="https://andrewhy.de/">Andrew Hyde</a> and I followed each other as well as exchanged some messages from time to time. So sure enough when I saw him and another guy were doing this I figured why not support it. Not only becasue I knew one of the two and appreciated what he was doing on the internet at the time but also because it was a really cool idea to create 3D dinosaurs puzzles out of old records.</p>
<p>So I not only backed the product but since they actually did create it and ship it I got my set of 5 Laser Cut Vinyl Record Puzzles in an amazing box set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_1975%E2%80%9385">Bruce Springsteen &amp; The Street Band</a>. Fast forward 12 years now and I still have not put them together but since being reminded of them knew exactly where I could find this amazing box set.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2024/cdb007d9-1f7f-4843-adab-0af9ade07ef4.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I do remember I was thinking I would wait at the time until my son was a little older and put them together with him but I packed it away and kind of forgot about it. So now I am debating do I actually break into these amazing things or let them sit for a while longer.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2024/818035b1-9046-4768-b6ed-7774a972ad98.jpg" alt="">
<em>Picture of one of the cut records and the diagram included so you have an idea of how it should go together.</em></p>
<p>Either way, I am again reminded how fun it is to Blog Garden and find small posts like this bring up memories and remind me of some interesting things and people I have come into contact with along the way.</p>

			 <p>What another year it has been. It has been an interesting year and still busy as always. I keep thinking to myself that I should start these days, if not a month or so before my actual birthday but I feel there is something blocking me off from this time to reflect quickly and jot some things down. It is not to say I haven’t thought about it but I also don’t want this to feel like work or something I <em>have</em> to do. I want it to be something I <em>want</em> to do, so that is why I am doing it now while watching some snow fall and drinking some coffee.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2024/img-8397.jpeg" alt="A mug with &ldquo;ADVENTURE awaits&rdquo; text is resting on a wooden surface, with a snowy residential view seen through a window in the background."></p>
<p>This year was a really fun year at our seasonal camping spot. Between my wife and kids, I feel like someone was there as much as they possibly could be all summer long. I came back and worked from home during the weeks, typically with a kid or two (depending on activities), and went down earlier on weekends or sometimes took a Monday off and came back Monday night or Tuesday early. It has been a really enjoyable time down there this year by having more space in the new to us camper and just giving us a place to get away and not worry about things in our actual house. It then really feels like a weekend with no plans, versus if we would have been around our house, I would find odd projects and feel like I need to get stuff done there.
<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2023/4ea571cc6d.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Another quick fun thing that happened this past year was April’s brother got married and we all were able to spend time as a larger family for a weekend. Not only was that awesome, but the wedding was at April’s parents’ house overlooking the pond on their property. Besides the sweltering heat, it was just a lovely time.
<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2024/img-5994-edited.jpeg" alt="">
<em>Down in Ollie, IA for April’s brother’s wedding at her parents’ farmhouse.</em></p>
<p>As of the first of this year, my parents moved up to Minnesota which has already been great. We have been able to see them more, and they have been able to come to so many more kid events than before they would not have been able to. I don’t think they will be busy anytime soon with 6 grandkids in all kinds of activities. It was a little strange when I was back at my parents’ house in December, knowing that this town I grew up in and this house I grew up in will probably be one of the last times I am here. Not that I won’t go back for my reunions from time to time, but other than that, I have less of a pull to head back that way. I am good with closing that chapter of my life and excited that my kids will have a new different relationship with my parents as they live so close. Now I just have more boxes of stuff they have dropped off and I am slowly working throughout in my <em>shed office</em>.</p>
<p>For me personally over this past year, I don’t have too much to report, as I didn’t really do much but try to keep running as I have but didn’t really do any big races but found a <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2023/10/07/trout-brook-ten.html">trail race</a> in the fall that was just fun as there were no expectations. As I type this today after a really long run yesterday, I actually don’t have any plans for the upcoming year, which I know I really need to start thinking about. I guess for now I will just refer back to Brendan Leonard of Semi-Rad’s philosophy called <a href="https://semi-rad.com/2021/02/the-zen-of-running/">The Zen of Running</a> I will “put in the miles so I can…. put in the miles so I can…”</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2023/080b9392-35d1-4cd5-b8d5-972d1c7e9c97.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Last year this time I was thinking of focusing on connections, and I am not 100% sure I really did it complete justice at this point. However, from a work perspective, I have over the course of the last couple of months been trying to double down on it. I think it is the one thing that makes 100% virtual work hard is you can’t have as many chance visits. So, starting and since my visit in December, I have made it a point to find people in the office and/or let some of the local people know I am around. I need to <em>force</em> myself to do this with some friends of mine, as sometimes in the throes of the weeks I can still make too many excuses.</p>
<p>For this next year Resilience will be the theme, and my family has taken a liking to it as well. I actually a couple weeks back wrote this exact quote down on a piece of paper and put it in the kitchen for the kids to see every day (well and myself).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Resilience is knowing that you are the only one that has the power and the responsibility to pick yourself up.&quot;</strong> Mary Holloway.</p>

			 <p>Spent today with these two girls and had fun with limited plans. We played some Arcade games at Dave and Busters, ate some rolled Ice Cream, did some shopping 😵, played in an empty pool, and then ended the night with a yummy dessert from the lounge while watching a movie in the hotel room.</p>

			 <p>When we started the goal was 8 as we both have been a little down for the count. As we approached stopping at 12 I swayed the vote to <a href="https://strava.com/activities/10981665519">run</a> another loop to get us on par with plan. Overall legs were good but my stomach not so much but we got the miles. Also ,we have been spoiled as it was cold today!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In my <a href="https://www.thingelstad.com/2023/09/04/blog-gardening.html">blog gardening</a> <em>(thank you <a href="https://www.thingelstad.com/">Jamie</a> I am stealing your term)</em> I have stumbled across when I was in Germany for two weeks for work back in 2018. Granted I only have a handful of pictures that are in this blog and most of them came through my Instagram import I did a while back.</p>
<p>However, as I have been cleaning up some of the posts I see by adding the location of where the picture was shot for reference (thanks to Google Location Tracking), it has got me thinking should I take a little bit of extra time and recreate some events on my site? Maybe more specifically at a minimum, recreate or document places we visited and saw as I did for my family Trip out East and around Superior a couple years back (note you will not find it on the site yet as I kept track and never could figure out how I wanted to publish it). I do wish I did a better job of keeping track of those types of events or trips prior to the past year or so.</p>
<p>I was talking to my uncle the other day and my Grandfather (his dad) who was an accountant and had to bill his time to his clients by the hour kept record of pretty much everything he did but in very brief formats. He had a paper journal book for every year that would lay out people he met with and events in his life. For example, I saw the entry of where my mom was born (they wrote a different name than was hers so I guess they changed it later) in the morning and then in the afternoon it seems my grandfather had to go back to work as he then billed a client a handful of hours working on something. He also wrote down how much everything cost which was interesting to see that back then it only cost $18 for delivery and two nights in the hospital. Not sure how much insurance covers then but that is a shocking number compared to even what it cost for my kids 9-14 years ago.</p>
<p>I think of all that work he used to do journaling briefly moments of his life and I wish I had something similar but I do get caught up in that do I capture enough or do I capture too much. However, I just wrote out a paragraph of text explaining the couple of sentences I saw and could piece it together and found it interesting.</p>
<p>Now granted this day and age we even have the further benefits of quickly adding photos, GPS tracking, and stuff other data that could be easily included to our events in our life. However, that might be the problem is we try to correlate or craft the perfect end product vs just quickly jotting something down that if anything will jog our memory to what we were doing or thinking at that moment in our life. Maybe life changing like a birth or once in a life time trip or maybe just something like met a new friend in person for the first time.</p>
<p>One could say that sounds great start today and move forward why go back and put together something that took place 6 years ago. Well, I think it is because I have still been finding great joy in clicking the &ldquo;On this Day&rdquo; button and finding out what I did years ago. This is also the perfect time to remind myself and anyone else that needs some encouragement that in the end I am not doing it for anyone but <em>myself</em>. Maybe in the end my kids will look through it but I am not counting on that if anything it is interesting for me now so why not!</p>

			 <p>Where did the trail go? I thought they hadn’t started construction around Braemar yet and I was right and wrong as I found myself <a href="https://strava.com/activities/10947189918">running</a> through chopped up trees. Let’s just say I don’t know if I was on the trail at points, had to walk over bad parts, and I got some nice cuts on my legs.</p>

			 <p>Say what you will about ride-sharing companies, but honestly, a coworker and I arrived at the airport at the same time and were going to share a cab. However, we were staying at different hotels 2 blocks apart.</p>
<p>The person coordinating the cabs said &ldquo;nope you have two people and two destinations, so you need two cabs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was 11:30pm at night and I am sure the look of confusion crossed my face when I just said whatever we need one cab. Honestly, what the heck? That is the dumbest thing I have ever heard, as I could have just used Uber and selected two drop-off locations.</p>
<p>So, what did I do? Told my co-worker to jump in the cab and we would head to his hotel. The cabbies when we walked over to the cabs questioned me about the 1 and 2 locations but I just said we were going to his hotel. I can walk 2 blocks vs spending another $25 for a different cab to goto the same location.</p>
<p>Granted, it wasn&rsquo;t my money, but it was a matter of principle.</p>

			 <p>Start of the week so I wanted to make sure to get some miles in. However, I quickly realized that my body was not ready for 58°F with lots of sun to <a href="https://strava.com/activities/10842706784">run</a> in again. This felt much worse than it should have.</p>

			 <p>I decided to flex my lunch today and get this <a href="https://strava.com/activities/10815894336">run</a> in since it is <em>short weather</em>! Day started crazy at work with lots of little things to tackle so I ended up working in the  dining room as I didn’t have a break long enough to make  it to my “office”. I guess I had that lunch break but priorities. 😁</p>

			 <p>I think the idea of drafts still is very compelling but there is a part of me thinking there is just to much it can do and I really just am overwhelmed by all the buttons and sidebars. 🤷‍♂️</p>
<p>I kind of wish it had either a first time setup or almost hide anything/everything more than the text editor basic stuff. I get the power is everything else but since I know I might only use one or two things right away it is just very cluttered and I feel like I want more of a blank environment when I am typing on my phone (now) or earlier on my Mac.</p>
<p>I am going to give this a go for a little bit longer to see if it fits in my workflow of life.</p>

			 <p>Since I&rsquo;ve been trying to post more photos to some.pics, I found that even with the shortcut, it was a bit cumbersome. I had to then log into the website to add a description to it, or I was just uploading it directly to the app. However, as I was updating a status on status.lol the other day through the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6444921793">status.lol app</a> made by the amazing <a href="https://jmj.omg.lol/">Joanna</a>, I was reminded that you can upload pictures to some.pics through there as well. I can&rsquo;t believe I had forgotten this.</p>
<p>So, what a nice and useful app for the iPhone, which allows you to update your status on status.lol, add some pictures to some.pics, and not to mention, if you are trying to find some neat people as part of the omg.lol community, there is a directory button in there as well that you can search and navigate to their omg.lol page.</p>
<p>I have been uploading my pictures for the last couple of days through the app, and I really do find it that much easier to do so. My only feature request now is that for anyone else who has a picture uploaded, I wish I could click on their username and have it take me to their some.pics gallery or maybe their omg.lol page. I guess that is where it is hard to know what I would really want to do, as neither of those options allow me to say, &ldquo;Hey, really cool picture,&rdquo; unless I found my way to their social.lol account as well. It isn&rsquo;t that it isn&rsquo;t possible, but just not as easy quite yet. Unlike, on the status.lol side of things, if they post it to Mastodon (i.e., social.lol), you can click on it and reply there.</p>
<p>I wonder if there will be some connection at some point to have your some.pics be easily shared to social.lol? I would guess the only issue there is the description for some.pics is typically alt text vs. a description or some caption you might add, or at least that is what I have been using it for. Not sure what everyone else is doing, as it just says you need a description, but I typically have it describe the picture vs. just posting the picture as part of a description.</p>

			 <p>I have not actually used <a href="https://paste.lol/">paste.lol</a> all that much on but really it is a Pastebin for those of you who know what that is. I did use it already at one point to save a json to rss script file that I created with other help I found online for a specific use on my Micro.blog consumption. <em>More on that script another time.</em></p>
<p>The other day, I was reminded me the other day about past.lol and as always because someone took the great omg.lol creation and then added to it by creating a web app where you can write (like I am now) and save them directly to Pastbin. The app can be found at <a href="https://write.omg.lol">write.omg.lol</a>.</p>
<p>Depending on what you want to use paste.lol for maybe it would not be that useful but for writing like I am right now, I can write in Markdown, quickly view it using the eyes in the upper right hand corner and save it to Pastbin as I go along. Obviously, in the end I am going to copy this over to my weblog.lol but you could just leave this as a single page of notes on your past bin site that I will do as well just to see how it works as well. Remember if anything you can create fun pictures in paste.lol like below:</p>

			 <p>The <a href="https://now.garden">now.garden</a> feature on omg.lol has me wondering how many people are utilizing the weblog service. I ponder whether there could be a directory or a &ldquo;find my feed&rdquo; feature, similar to what Adam has assembled for other services (e.g., some.pics, status.lol, now.garden). While it&rsquo;s possible to search and find people by usernames, taking it a step further with a page organized by titles and/or an RSS feed to subscribe to would be beneficial. Now that I think about it, such a feature probably exists, and I just haven&rsquo;t discovered it yet.</p>
<p><em>I was going to just include this as part of my earlier post about the <a href="https://ericmwalk.weblog.lol/2024/02/now-page">now page</a> when I talked about the now.garden but then I realized it probably should be it&rsquo;s own thought.</em></p>

			 <p>It probably took me too long, but I finally managed to put together a &ldquo;<a href="https://ericmwalk.omg.lol/now">now</a>&rdquo; page on omg.lol. At this point, it&rsquo;s pretty basic, and I might work on it a bit more here and there. One thing I&rsquo;m interested in, because I&rsquo;ve known about this &ldquo;now&rdquo; page concept in the past, is whether I will update it after today. I could see myself doing this work now and then forgetting I had a page like that, never returning to it a week or two later. However, there&rsquo;s a setting in your &ldquo;now&rdquo; page that can nudge you every so many days. I picked 7 to keep it consistent, so we&rsquo;ll see if that spurs me to update it next week.</p>
<p>Another interesting feature specific to omg.lol users is the &ldquo;<a href="https://now.garden">now garden</a>.&rdquo; Everyone on omg.lol who has a &ldquo;now&rdquo; page and checks the box to make it visible in the garden shows up there. It&rsquo;s sorted by the most recent update, which is nice because then you can click around if you&rsquo;re curious to see how other people have created theirs or if you&rsquo;re wondering what people are up to&hellip; NOW.</p>
<p><em>If you are wondering what a Now Page is and got to the end check out this <a href="https://home.omg.lol/info/now">omg.lol now page reference</a> that also links to the origination of a now page for even <strong>more</strong> information.</em></p>

			 <p>I didn&rsquo;t really spend any time today diving into more stuff on Weblog.lol, but I did look closer at some.pics as I had a picture I took this morning on an early morning run. So, I did find a <a href="https://discourse.lol/t/some-pics-ios-shortcut/186">shortcut</a> that you can download if you would like something like that, thanks to <a href="https://maique.omg.lol">Maique</a>. The one nice thing I found is that although it says that pictures are not shared publicly without a description, that really means as of this point, it will not show up in some.pics main feed or your own some.pics feed. However, you can still use that markdown code to put on your own site.</p>
<p>I do want to preface this by saying that before you go crazy uploading a ton of photos or even screenshots, do read the <a href="https://home.omg.lol/info/picture-sharing">Community Guidelines</a> and especially what the service isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Final note as I kept diving into some.pics is that I could put it on my <a href="https://ericmwalk.omg.lol">omg.lol</a> page at the bottom with the following script:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>{

 &lt;script src=&quot;https://some.pics/by/ericmwalk.js?count=1&amp;alt&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 

}
</code></pre><p>There might be more that you can do with it, but it does fit what I would want at the bottom of my omg.lol page. Now that I have somewhat updated that page and taken a closer look at some.pics, I wonder if I should, at some point, take a closer look at the &ldquo;now&rdquo; page. 🤔</p>

			 <p>In reading more chatter online, it seems like people are really checking out all of these newer indie blogging software which is great and each is on its own journey of what they doing. I think the one thing for weblog that people seem to run across as a downfall is getting images here because you really need to find another place to put them if you want more than a one-off. Through the OMG.lol suite of products, you can use <a href="https://some.pics">some.pics</a> and honestly, it would probably work fine for one-off photos or if you were not planning on posting a ton of photos to the site. However, if you wanted to post say the picture from a trip or more than just one you might find it more difficult than other platforms where you can just drop them all in and away you go. I believe in this case you can upload them all but might then take a little back and forth to get the links to your post. Here is a photo that I uploaded a while back and it works fine as you can see using some.pics</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.some.pics/ericmwalk/64cc3b6b498fd.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>The more I think about it someone has probably created a shortcut to make this even simpler.</em></p>
<p>With all of that said, I am going to take some guesses that more might be in store to somehow make it easier at some point in the weblog app but you have to be ok waiting for that which for me is fine because right now I am just sending the photos to my micro.blog account for the ones I have posted on this site so far. The only exception is the one above. Others I have heard use <a href="https://bunny.net">bunny.net</a> or other services to have photos hosted somewhere and then just link them in here. I could see that as being a nice option as then you can probably organize and find them if you ever want to use one again. That is sometimes the downside I have found with <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> because I like to use a picture I had or if I am cleaning up things I am not sure how to easily find the picture to delete it or replace it so then it just gets lost out there not attached to any post. I am guessing this could be an issue with some of the <a href="/2024/02/it-works-but-how-does-this-work-again">other services</a> I mentioned the other day and might be the same for some.pics but I shouldn&rsquo;t say that too fast as I know it wants to have you put a description so maybe you can find it that way.</p>

			 <p>I still like the work that I did late last week on the theme of this site, but I kept thinking I didn&rsquo;t have the colors right, as what I really wanted was something closer to the Dracula styling. Now, one could go through and change everything that I have done or snagged from others to get this looking like it is today. Or, I took the HTML template and put it in ChatGPT and asked it to update my theme in the Dracula style, and about 10 seconds later, what you are looking at now is the result. It would have most likely taken me much longer to get to the same result. I would have changed some things, checked it, and then repeated the process over and over, making sure that I got everything.</p>
<p>I have been finding more and more little uses for ChatGPT lately, so I have just kept it open in a tab on my computer. I was using it to help flesh out some ideas and thoughts at work, and I felt like it really helped out. So, two weeks ago, I decided to pay for a month of the Plus version to see what else the 4.0 can do for me compared to 3.5. I don&rsquo;t know if I have really used the Plus version to the fullest yet, but I am still just getting warmed up to more uses. I want to test out the GPTs that you can create. I created one the day I signed up for the service, but honestly, I have not spent much time with it or even using it, except for answering the questions during the setup and then maybe one or two right after that.</p>
<p>I hope to spend some more time overall with ChatGPT before my month is up, so I can figure out if I want to keep the paid version for longer. I think most of what I have been doing today could just be done on the free version, except for some of the images I have created, but really, those are only for fun and not a necessity.</p>

			 <p>So I tried to make a post yesterday and had no idea why I didn&rsquo;t see it, figuring it would show up eventually. This morning, when I still didn&rsquo;t see it, it dawned on me. I didn&rsquo;t put the <code>.md</code> at the end of it, so the file was never picked up and posted. 🤦‍♂️</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good thing to remember that adding <code>.md</code> is a better way to create a draft than putting &ldquo;draft&rdquo; in the top section, at least if you are using GitHub. Because I found out, even if you put &ldquo;draft&rdquo; at the top of your file, it might not show up on your main post pages. But when you do searches, especially for tags, you will find the file.</p>
<p>Yesterday&rsquo;s entry and this one are all coming from my phone. I installed <a href="https://workingcopy.app/">Working Copy</a> which I connect to GitHub. With this setup, it&rsquo;s quite nice. It gives me a time that I can actually create a post like this one right here offline and then push it when I&rsquo;m ready. Seeing how I am sitting at a swim meet typing this out and waiting for my daughter to swim which will be in another hour.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2024/img-7748.png" alt="Person using a smartphone, possibly taking a photo, with an indoor swimming competition in the background. Spectators seated, swimmers in lanes, vibrant pool area. No text present."></p>
<p>My only issue with Working Copy is that on my phone it is not giving me predictive text or correcting my bad spelling that is happening due to me typing on this phone. Not the end of the world but a little annoying, but I also know why it makes sense to not have it correct or give suggestions as normally people would use this app to write code. Maybe I will start drafting this in a different text editor and then just use Working Copy to post.</p>
<p>I know this is only day 4, but I think the more I mess around with weblogs, the more I seem to like it.</p>

			 <p>Some days it is good to flex different brain muscles and do something outside your comfort zone. Today for me that was spending some quality time tinkering with <a href="weblog.lol">weblogs.lol</a> since I have not touched my corner of the world there since almost a year ago. It was <em>fun</em> and happy <a href="https://ericmwalk.weblog.lol/2024/02/spending-time-with-weblog">with it for now</a>.</p>

			 <p>I have spent way more time than I would like to admit messing around with weblog.lol today. However, I am pleased with the overall result as I have a <em>working</em> website with an updated theme that I am happy with in the direction it is taking. I jokingly say <em>working</em> because for the life of me, the box below I cannot get to format right, no matter what I do. However, if you look at it now, it probably looks good enough that no one will be the wiser on how much effort I spent tinkering with it.</p>
<p>Reflecting back, I realized that since I haven&rsquo;t really touched this site since a year ago, I had some very old configurations and knowledge of what was going on (not that I really had the right knowledge to begin with). So, some of my time today was spent watching a very helpful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mdr1uDiwcO4">video</a> Adam (the creator of weblog.lol and omg.lol) put together earlier last year, as well as diving into some webpage source codes. Only to then find out some very nice people have their weblog.lol sites like mine on GitHub with it open to view the configuration files. I&rsquo;m not sure if those people meant to have them as public projects on GitHub, so I will not link directly to them, but I do appreciate that they did, as I could get some ideas of how things were done by doing that. I am not really sure if I will end up closing mine off and making it private, as I am not sure if there is anything here that should be closed off. However, if I do, I will make sure to link to a copy of my template and configuration files, as those are the things really helpful if you are a noob like me when it comes to weblog and honestly CSS.</p>
<p>If you are wondering what is next with this site, it is still <strong>to be determined</strong>, but I have enjoyed my time diving into it and flexing my brain in a way I normally don&rsquo;t on a day-to-day basis. Maybe I will try to post something on here every day for February and see how that goes.</p>

			 <p>It works, but how does this work again?</p>
<p>With all of the new fun blogging tools that have been coming out lately, I have been wanting to try every single one of them, and I am probably still missing some of them. However, here are the ones that caught my eye, and I have tried two of them, and I know the other one would be amazing too:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pika.page/">Pika.Page</a> by the awesome people who make fun things at <a href="https://goodenough.us">Good Enough</a></li>
<li><a href="https://scribbles.page">Scribbles</a> by Vincent Ritter, who makes some really cool projects that you should check out.</li>
<li><a href="https://gibber.blog">Gibber or Gibberish is the app</a> - The idea of it being like text messages really is an interesting concept.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, as I had been trying some of these and almost pulled the trigger to try the other one, I thought to myself. I still have this amazing weblog.lol site that I have not touched for a year that I should get back to. If anything, just to see what it is all about and what has changed, so maybe that is what I will do instead of diving too much further into the three listed above. In fact, as I was messaging <a href="https://bjhess.com">Barry Hess</a> who helped create Pika.Page briefly about this exact topic, I found his response just refreshing when I said I am not sure I can fully switch to another platform:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not a problem! If you have something that fits the bill, of course, we’d love to have you along for the ride. But don’t force it!</p>

Kind of surprises me since March 30, 2011 nothing was posted since I have pulled in old (not great) blog posts and Instagram. This has been corrected now 😄</p>

			 <p>Such a strange winter this has been&hellip; I should step back to say that originally I was kind of on the fence if I didn&rsquo;t want to do a hockey rink this year just because I felt it was not used as much as I would have liked to have seen it last year. However, on a whim and looking at weather forecasts in November I quickly decided to put the boards up and then order a tarp from a new company. Then the weather started to get warm and I waited&hellip;. and waited&hellip; Like I have done since learning that valuable lesson in my earlier years. However, fast forward to today and it is December 27th and the weather may maybe getting close to the right conditions as you can see from my chart below but I am asking myself a very important question. Am I going to finish building the rink for the 2023-2024 Season?</p>
<p>Such a hard questions as I have a streak going of 9 years and not to mention a good handful of the work is already done with the <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2023/11/17/well-decisions-were.html">boards up</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I guess I always do say never say never so who knows maybe in the last moment I will change my mind but I don&rsquo;t think so as of right now. I don&rsquo;t take it lightly though breaking a good streak right before a round number but this winter is not what I would have expected and once January 2nd hits everyone will be busy again as normally between Christmas and New Year is when we use the rink the most. Hopefully, looking forward to the 2024-2025 season as I will still have the tarp now and should be ready to go. Guess I will have to (unless I change my mind) since everything is purchased and only labor is needed.</p>

			 <p>Last year was the first year for a <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2023/01/11/another-hr-drive.html">Christmas gift to my son</a> I took him to the Iowa State men&rsquo;s basketball game. I pulled him out of school a little early and we did a 3 hour trip down to Ames, Iowa for a 7pm game and then once it was done make the 3 hr drive home getting back around 1am.</p>
<p>This year he was asking for the same thing again as he had a great time and wanted to go watch another game. So around the first part of November, I looked into it and found that not only could we watch the <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2023/12/17/basketball-game-two.html">mens game</a> but the <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2023/12/17/basketball-game-one.html">womens game</a> as well. So yesterday was the day where we woke up at early to be on the road by 7am to watch a noon women&rsquo;s game and then a 5pm mens game. The games couldn&rsquo;t have turned out any better for a fan or even someone that isn&rsquo;t a fan as we were able to see both teams pretty handily win. My parents joined in on the fun and came to both games as well as a dinner in between both at <a href="https://hickoryparkbbq.com">Hickory Park Restaurant</a>. Our seats were pretty good as I didn&rsquo;t get them right when tickets would have come out and since the College kids are on break I was able to snag us front-row seats for the women&rsquo;s game and the first row in the upper deck for the men. Both seats I thought were good and for different reasons.</p>
<p>Luckily, the men&rsquo;s game only lasted around 2 hrs so we could get on the road in good time and made it back to Eden Prairie by 10:30pm. I had a great day spending time with my son as we don&rsquo;t always have a free day where neither of us has something going on. I guess I need to put a reminder in my calendar for when the games come out so I can be on the front end of planning for next year and what games we might go watch.</p>

This run started out with me unsure what was going to happen but actually felt good and tried to keep up a quicker pace than normal.</p>

			 <p>First Apple Watch Ultra fail today as for some reason it paused the workout. Glad I caught it after not to long but it did cut me a little short.

Feeling sluggish today and hoped this <a href="https://strava.com/activities/10343865466">run</a> would do the trick after traveling back to Minnesota early this morning. I think it worked but limited sleep is probably my problem.</p>

			 <p>I would say for at least the past year I have been pretty true to using Markdown when publishing stuff on this here blog and more specifically making sure that I use Markdown in order to post my running pictures on a very frequent basis 😄 (this goes for other pictures too). However, I realized yesterday is there a benefit in doing so since the Micro.blog app uploads photos to HTML? I use Gluon too but I think you have to click the inline part to make it be markdown. I guess I am just wondering if it actually gets me anything to do so or if it is a little overkill anyways. If I use Markdown, which I actually don&rsquo;t mind doing for text purposes but then just use HTML for the actual inserting of photos does it make a difference or will it make it harder if that day ever comes that I just export everything to have offline to view as some things will be in Markdown and other things in HTML?</p>
<p>This is probably more on my mind right now as I have been a little all over the place in Notes apps over the past year, as I just noticed my Craft.doc subscription went though for another 12 months before I got a chance to canceled it. 😖 I am still using Obsidian, which I am typing this in right now because it feels right and I can access it across devices with a simple click of a button it gets published to Micro.blog thanks to the <a href="https://otavio.cc/micropublish/">Micro.Publish</a> extension created by <a href="https://micro.blog/otaviocc">@Otaviocc</a>. With that said I am really only using Obsidian for my work notes so a great example is once I publish this I will delete it from Obsidian otherwise it gets messy when searching for things while working. This is where it would be great to have two Obsidian vaults open at once but that is a grip for another time.</p>
<p>So for anyone that has any thoughts or opinions I am open to hearing if there is a benefit or not or if it is just personal preference.</p>

			 <p>Walking my daughter out to the bus like I do almost every morning I am here reminds me of the small things that I get to take advantage of working remotely. Just the small conversations, not always happy as she doesn&rsquo;t like getting on the bus at 7am, but overall it is these moments I didn&rsquo;t have with my other kids and sometimes real conversations come out as it is just genuine and in the moment. I will miss them in a couple of years when she is older and will not want me to walk her to the bus stop anymore. So I will continue to try and cherish these days even when she is angry for me making her goto school. 🥰</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I had worried about this day from the point my kids went to a bigger school 8x the size of the one that I did growing up. Yes from an education perspective where we live is a great place to be but,  growing up for me I loved playing sports too. To be fair I just liked playing sports to hang out with friends but also because I just liked doing things. True some sports I was probably more “in it to win it” focused than others but overall I could do them all and that isn’t because I was a stellar athlete. Running sure, I worked hard after my Freshman and Sophomore years to make sure I was one of our top runners for cross country and found a niche for myself in track running 800s and 400s.</p>
<p>However, this isn’t just a story about my memories yet I should in my future right more of them down so when I am old I won’t forget. This is a story about my kids, but more specifically my oldest who found out tonight that he did not make a Freshman team 😔. I had a feeling this day would come as he was mostly always on the 3 team out of 4 for Travel basketball and once you hit Freshman year they only take 2 teams ~18-20 kids out of the 64 that tried out this year. Granted other years my son in theory was in the top 18-27 (as they took 9 to a team) so it wasn’t that there wasn’t a chance but he had a hill to climb as you also get new kids coming out or kids that moved into the district. So here we are today and the die has been cast unfortunately not in his favor.</p>
<p>It isn’t to say that the kid can’t still play basketball but it isn’t the same, I can still play basketball today but that is not like playing in High School. I was able to do that because I lived in a small school and I was not by any means a good basketball player. I only stopped playing voluntarily before my Senior year because I wanted to lift and run so I was ready for my last time on a track the following spring (I might have felt good about my running but I knew my career would be over in High School). The other thing that bothers me in today’s youth sports world and maybe it isn’t just at a big school but you have to specialize early on. They say they want multisport athletes but then there are camps year round that you have the “opportunity” to attend and you end up devoting yourself to that sport with never a guarantee that there is a spot for you down the road. Not saying it is right but if at HS age they then said hey you are on the team and now this is your only focus, maybe that would make more sense or I would feel better about such a thing even though I still don’t agree with that. However, it is still so hard for me to comprehend as it was never an issue for me and back when I was younger we played a sport a season not one sport for our youth career. That is something I have disliked during my kids time growing up it seems like kids do benefit from doing it year round but that still isn’t a guarantee that everyone will still thrive by doing it year round because you never know what kind of camps or coaches you get in the offseason to push you forward.</p>
<p>It is still crazy to me to think of all the kids that got cut today and I would say probably 10-15 of those kids if they were in a smaller school most likely would have had a shot to continue to play in High School in front of a crowd of people on a Friday night.  However, now all of these kids have swag ball, which from what I can tell is like a pickup game of basketball on the weekend which kind of sounds like something I could be a candidate for today. Well, probably not as I am not that tall or still not very good (maybe worse).</p>
<p>Proud of all my son had one over all his years of basketball and I just hope he knows that it is not the end of playing as this is just a setback. I know it will take him some time to get excited about it again as I am sure it is tough as he needs to process all the feelings. However, there are other options just probably not the one he was hoping for and in the end, basketball is one of those things he can continue to do for quite a long time at his age.</p>

			 <p>With the warmer weather yesterday I shut off all the heaters in my shed office. It isn&rsquo;t that cold today but a little more chilly than I would like seeing how I wore short sleeves this morning.</p>

			 <p>Had a dentist appointment this morning which was right next to these two lakes that has a nice trail around it so I took advantage. Probably should have tried to mix some more speed in this <a href="https://strava.com/activities/10217417552">run</a> but with the wind at my face this seemed like a good pace to just cruise and enjoy the beautiful day.</p>

Wasn’t sure how far I was going to <a href="https://strava.com/activities/10199908577">run</a> but happy with how it turned out and where I went. Last mile talked with my wife the whole time on the phone which was different but fun too.</p>

			 <p>Tuesday Trails! Found some time today to explore a lot of the Purgatory Park trails in this nice weather. Based on my map it makes it look like I had no idea where I was <a href="https://strava.com/activities/10177692815">running</a> to and I guess that is kind of accurate but I was never lost. 😃</p>

			 <p>Yep, it does get dark quick in the evening. I didn’t have my lights and was mostly in the dark during this <a href="https://strava.com/activities/10173570160">run</a>.  However, I didn’t get hit by cars or trip on the sidewalks so I guess a win.</p>

I think the hardest part right now is a lot is in flux as I have started to use a Mac for my work job but more on that another time.

			 <p>We have gotten a lot of water the past couple of days and the marsh is showing it as the water is almost to the bottom of the boards. The <a href="https://strava.com/activities/10108496266">run</a> was good but a little slick on these planks and a lot of mud. Also, got cut short thinking I was going to miss a meeting that in turn got canceled.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2023/10/26/foundry-by-eliot.html">Foundry by Eliot Peper</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>What can I say Eliot Peper did it again with <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781735016528">Foundry</a>! From the moment it started the whole story was a fast-paced, entertaining, and almost too close-to-reality near-future spy novel. Needless to say, I could not put the book down or stop listening to it when I was away from the physical book. I really enjoyed how this book (compared to his others) took a different style in approach by being written in first person and I even found when listening to it (also appreciated it was his voice) it was like someone was telling me a story as we sat across a table drinking a cortado.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I think this book was the perfect way to do such a thing and as always allowed for all the twists and turns as the bigger story unfolded. As always, I enjoy hearing easter eggs from prior books as he might reference places and technology but you would not have had to read those books before to enjoy this one. The attention to all details between the characters and the scenery made me feel like I was part of the overall storytelling journey.</p>
<p>Eliot does such a great job of writing these types of near-future stories like these where the plot and things that happen are very realistic and not so far-fetched to what we hear in the news. However, I think it also goes to show the detail in which he researches various technologies and topics to ensure it has that real feel to the story. This is found in how he describes places, food, drinks, and technology. Overall, this is another great book put out into the world by Eliot! I am sure he is sick of hearing this from me but… I can’t wait for the next one!</p>

			 <p>Oddly enough I was just saying earlier this week I should find a trail race to run but I have been dragging my feet a lot. Well that is all over now because of a pending deadline of having to register by midnight tonight for <a href="https://ultrasignup.com/register.aspx?did=99846">The Trout Brook</a> race I found earlier in the week. Amazing what can happen when you really have to make a decision quick as I only realized the deadline tonight. However, I do believe that this is probably a good millage for my first <strong>Trail</strong> Run. I might not be in the best <em>race</em> shape I could be going into this but honestly I am kind of going for more of the experience and not worried to much about my overall time. I think what helped push me to this race is that I have been to the area before camping and it has always been our favorite and I think that is what kept nagging at me for the past couple of days. Oddly enough I can not find in my quick searching what the exact route is going to be to get to the 10 miles (or 1 eric as a specific person calls it) but I am sure I have covered 90% of the trails around Willow River Falls from our camping trips there (<a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2020/10/16/nothing-beats-a.html">2020-10-16</a>, <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2020/10/18/got-out-early.html">2020-10-18</a>, <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/10/22/photoblogging-day-rest.html">2021-10-22</a>). If anyone is bored or free and wants to join me there is a couple hours left to register and we can muddle through it together.</p>

			 <p>Found out late yesterday that the ethernet cable that connects my shed office to the house has a broken connection somewhere. I wonder how long the connection has been broken as I do know I have sometimes had some limited connection issues over the past month but chalked it up to a blimp or Google Meets. I guess the good thing is my Orbi Mesh Wifi just connected to the house wirelessly once it realized the cable was not working but obviously that is where my connection was not as strong as before. Long story short the quick fix as of late yesterday was to just drop a new cable in my yard. So yes, I currently have an ethernet cable just sitting on top of my grass going from the house to my shed office. I mean what could possibly go wrong with this. 🙄🦌</p>

<p>More to come on this story as I need to figure out if the burred part of the cable is broken or in a place where the line was exposed. I am hoping above ground and I can just piece things together.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2023/08/10/the-seven-summits.html">&#34;The Seven Summits of My Neighborhood&#34; video by Brendan Leonard</a></h1>

			 <p>Nice find in my email today that a friend Brendan Leonard has a new film out today titled <a href="https://youtu.be/7SLadjqxhhc">“The Seven Summits of My Neighborhood”</a> which I found very entertaining and insightful. It reminds me that as much adventure can be found all around the world sometimes there is more than you think to explore or “create your own fun” in the area you live that is worth exploring. There are a bunch of little quotes and insights throughout this video but the one I laughed out loud and probably was just a one-off comment though resonated with me as a runner was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This trail is what I think you would call “Deceptively Runnable”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have been known to run in areas that are “deceptively runnable and turn out to be more work than planned.</p>
<p>You can read some more about the making of the film and how he got the idea on his website <a href="https://semi-rad.com/2023/08/new-film-the-seven-summits-of-my-neighborhood/">Semi-Rad</a>.</p>

I realized I haven’t ventured to the trails North of my house for a while and it was a peaceful morning in the Conservation area. The only movement I saw was a herd of deer who I am sure I scared and they went jumping through the wooded area in the middle.</p>

			 <p>These things have been swirling around in my mind all day. Some are actual questions I am pondering and probably need to look for advice from others that have similar issues (e.g., kids backups) and then others are just random things I am thinking about today. It might be the early morning hour I woke up, got a run in and have consumed a fair amount of coffee.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the best approach to backup all of my kids phone and computers (only 1 has one at this time)?</li>
<li>Should I change up how I store photos and where I have my backups? I think I have about 4 places right now all in and videos are still a wild card.</li>
<li>Note-taking is still a mess as to where I put what but I have downsized one by one by finally getting rid of Evernote but also increased one by starting to use Bear now as well 🤦‍♂️</li>
<li>File storage, probably should shift to just one platform as I have some in Google Drive and now some in iCloud.</li>
<li>I should really sign up for some sort of running race this year but leaning towards just a fun trail run.</li>
<li>Is there any more consolidation I should do on my Social Media or Online presence side of things?</li>
<li>Should I sell my iPad mini as I don’t know if I get enough value out of it today or what could do or use it for more?</li>
<li>I need to get back to being a more morning person as I enjoy those quiet hours in the morning before everything gets crazy.</li>
<li>Next time I take more than one day off I think I need to block off about 1/2 my morning on my first day back to just get back k up to speed (assuming I stepped away and didn’t keep checking email and working on break). I think that would help make the meeting later in the day or early the next more productive.</li>
<li>When posting a picture to Micro.blog should I have it posted in Markdown or HTML?</li>
<li>It would be nice from time to time e to tag a location in Micro.blog I feel like at one point there had been talk about that but I might be misremembering. I know there is shortcuts I can use to get a link in there but would be nice to make it more streamlined.</li>
<li>Wouldn’t it be great if it was easier to use Focus modes on Apple devices? I really like the idea and try to set it up a number of times but then I am never sure I set it upright. You know what they need some preset ones based on your usage and what you check right away or ignore. Well, maybe that isn’t ideal because we are trying to create a better habit by using it.</li>
<li>How did this list get so long! 😱</li>
</ul>

It was actually brutality hot outside today and I regretted my <a href="https://strava.com/activities/9526664643">running</a> route from about mile 2 on. However, when you pick an out and back location you can’t really cut the run short so I kept going.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>It might seem silly that I do this as I am sure some people might get sick of seeing a photo every other day or so with a link to Strava and some random thoughts of my run. I used to just post a photo on Instagram long before I stumbled on Micro.blog as most of the time back then my runs were early morning or in the evening and I enjoyed sharing a good sunrise or sunset photo. After I finished my 5k a day I think I stopped posting photos there and then it became more infrequent and only if I would find something interesting. Then I came to Micro.blog and after a while, I started posting running photos here but again infrequent and would never link to Strava until about a year ago. For some reason, I got this idea in my head that not only would I want a photo from my run with some random thoughts but a link to the route I did, which would tell me where I was also. I am sure no one else could care but it is my blog and a good way to document things to remember even though I wasn&rsquo;t sure when I would look back. Until the other day, I finished my run and clicked on the On This Day link I have and found out I ran the same tails a year ago!</p>
<p><em>Run from Last week <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2023/07/06/trails-convinced-my.html">Thursday July 6, 2023</a> and then my run from <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2022/07/06/really-nice-evening.html">Thursday July 6, 2022</a>. Kind of interesting I thought.</em></p>
<p>I know that in theory, Strava can capture the same information but that information is stored in a place that I can’t easily export and keep for the long run. I get I am using them to keep track of my route history but it is also stored in Apple Fitness going forward as well. I guess I should consider saving down my GPS data but at this point that is not all that important. However, I have taken the steps to retain some of the running information like miles, pace, and total time in my DayOne app. Which is kind of where this process today starts with the use of Shortcuts and another service called <a href="https://feedmyride.net">FeedMyRide</a>. <em>I will detail out and share the shortcut soon.</em></p>

			 <p>Kind of a last min <a href="https://strava.com/activities/9383478640">run</a> as I didn’t even have the right shoes on. However, since I dropped off our stuff for the Edina Parade I decided to run the route to see how long it really was.</p>

			 <p>Stroll around <a href="https://strava.com/activities/9376198482">Clear Lake and Maplewood Park</a> in what was some warm weather with lots of sun out.

			 <p>With it being 85°F outside today I was pleasantly surprised that the shed “office” stayed hovering around 70°F. I know the summer is just upon us but it has given me some hope that I might not have to upgrade my small AC unit yet and the insulation from last fall can get me through this summer. 🤞</p>

			 <p>Legs were a little sore from yesterday’s run as we might have been cruising faster than I should have. However, I went out with no expectation (like I normally do) but decided to <a href="http://www.strava.com/activities/8951055592">stroll</a> down the short nature trail by my house.</p>

			 <p>It is shocking for me to say that I am <strong>42</strong> years old today. Thinking back over the past year I feel I hit my goal of <strong>Embracing</strong> as there really was a lot going on. As seems to be the case the past couple of years, I have the intention of starting this little entry earlier and creating a draft in March. Then before you know it is the day before and I am trying to spend 30 min to capture what I remember that is tied to the outline I drafted then. As I am typing this right now I just got back from a &ldquo;<a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2023/03/24/no-better-way.html">birthday run</a>&rdquo; around a nearby lake and what better way to start the day. Except that I have a meeting with my boss soon so I need to make this fast 😀.</p>
<p>Travel was a big component of our Embracing the year because as a family we made an RV trip around Lake Superior with some friends which was amazing. So many fun memories from that one for years to come. The best part is they have 3 kids that line up pretty close to our kid&rsquo;s ages so that helps too. We got rained on, had a lot of campfires, and hiked and biked too.

<em>Walker Solie 2022 RV Superior Road Trip</em></p>
<p>Next up on the travel this year was a vacation that for the most part was driven by my parent&rsquo;s 50th Wedding anniversary. They told us during Christmas 2021, that they would rather spend some of the money we would maybe get in the future today together as a family. I mean how can you say no to that logic. Additionally, they made it super clear to my brother and I that they wanted to pay for our tickets, rental car, and the house that we would all be staying together at. It was super generous of them but also gave all of us an excuse to go hang out at the beach, play mini-golf, take nature hikes and just spend quality time with us away from all the busyness of our own lives. This is the 3rd trip that we have taken together like this over the past 10 years and as always it was a blast.

<em>The whole Walker Crew all 12 of us with custom shirts!</em></p>
<p>The two vacation trips were part of the plan last year but what wasn&rsquo;t was buying a seasonal spot at Keisler&rsquo;s to hang out for the other parts of the summer. This was one of the best and dumbest decisions we have made. The dumbest because the only spot available was an RV only spot which is perfect because we have an RV but also the most expensive. To add to that this is also during a summer we knew we would not be there for about 4 weeks out of it with the other trips (at a minimum). However, seeing how much fun the kids had spending free weeks there was great as well. I think this will have a short shelf life as our kids are getting older so we figured we would strike while the iron is hot.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2023/69de9d0873.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Tagging along right with that we sold our beloved <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2022/09/28/goodbye-rv.html">RV</a>. This was not in the plans but as we figured out that the kids wanted to spend as much time as possible this year at Keislers it didn&rsquo;t make sense to have the most expensive spot and a very expensive RV that would just sit all year instead of being driven like an RV should. So we sold it and found someone onsite selling their travel trailer for a good price. It is bigger and has more rooms than an RV so I think that will fit nicely as we plan on spending more of our summer down there and I hope do work from there a couple days a week as well.</p>
<p>Adding to embracing things in a roundabout way I started a new job that is 100% remote and located in Portland, ME. The crazy thing is how this came about and really this is where embracing conversations and past connections really pays off. I got a phone call 2 weeks before I was traveling to Maine for vacation this year from one of my old bosses who said she had the perfect job for me for a CFO she worked with. Fast forward a week I had talked to my now boss for an interview and really liked everything I was hearing about the job. On a chance, I said let&rsquo;s meet up and have coffee when I was in Portland, ME on vacation, and since he is an early morning person as well we had coffee steps from the hotel I had booked months ago that happened to be right by the office. It has been a great rollercoaster of a ride at this new company and I enjoy my time working from Shed office and the couple of trips I have already had to make to Portland.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2023/5dcf82a65e.jpg" alt="">
<em>My office I visit about once a month. It is in such a great location and is a very nice building.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2023/0f0157a2da.jpg" alt="">
<em>One great thing about Portland is they have a trail that runs along the water right by the hotel I stay at and the office.</em></p>
<p>I signed up for another <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2022/10/02/another-twin-cities.html">Marathon last</a> year on kind of a <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2022/09/20/here-we-go.html">whim</a>. However, if you do the 20th doesn&rsquo;t it make sense to do the 40th as well? The training for this cycle was not as great as the year before but my time was 1 min faster so I should be happy with that. Starting my new job one month before kind of threw a wrench into some of my longer runs and increased mileage. However, I finished it so I can check that box off and again proves that even if you feel bad out there for the last 6 miles or so, it sometimes is just mind over matter to put one foot in front of the other. Other than that I had continued to run and was going to give a go at running every day for a month in January until I got a bad run in with COVID after 21 days. Since then I have not felt 100% since but I keep slogging out those miles and so far I don&rsquo;t have any plans to run a Marathon this year. I am sure I will figure something out as the year goes on.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/3bee888fd3.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>How could I forget the one other thing that was new this year? We adopted another dog <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2023/03/22/darby-hatrick-walker.html">Darby Hatrick</a> who we fostered so I guess it was a &ldquo;Foster Fail&rdquo; as they call it. We are still kind of early on in his training but we all think he is a really good dog and should fit in nicely.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2023/62d6550a79.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>What is on the docket for this year you might ask?  Well, that is a good question and one I probably haven&rsquo;t spent enough time thinking about. I do know that I have been stuck on Embracing for a few years now and it is time to let that go as I feel like this year has done it justice. I might change this up as I go but I think right now I am leaning towards <strong>Connections</strong>.</p>

			 <p>Welcome to the family Darby ”Hatrick” Walker…</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2023/62d6550a79.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Yes, this was our foster dog <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2023/01/17/because-we-felt.html">Daffy</a>, who somehow, some way became another forever dog we have even though it was the busiest time to even think about adding another responsibility. At the end of the first week, the kids were in love with him and my wife and I were quite fond of him as well but couldn’t even fathom the number of activities and work ahead to try to make this work. We decided to ask for another week from Second Hand Hounds and they granted it, but as the second week went on I think we knew the answer was going to be yes as it was yet another week he was with us and we were all becoming attached. Don’t get me wrong potty training is never great and when everyone is busy it makes it that much harder. However, he seemed to catch on pretty fast as well as started sleeping through the night from 11pm-6am by the end of the first week. Seemed too perfect. So fast forward to today when our activities have now wound down, I am happy to say we still have him and glad we figured it out.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2023/fba7a62f1a.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Where the name came from you ask?</em> Well <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darby_Hendrickson">Darby (Hendrickson)</a> was the first Minnesota Wild player to <a href="https://history.vintagemnhockey.com/page/show/951091-xcel-energy-center">score on home ice</a> at the Excel Energy Center once the team was created in 2020. Our eldest son used to watch the History of the Minnesota Wild over and over all the time when he was younger so needless to say it has been ingrained in our heads.</p>

			 <p>These girls work hard this weekend only allowing 1 goal in for 4 games and to get beat in the Championships to the number 1 team in the state in shootouts. Second place should not be lost on them and they should be proud! It was such a fun hockey weekend and I was glad my wife and I could snap a couple photos of the team as well as our daughter. My favorite is the picture of her smiling at me during that final game before a faceoff I will cherish.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>About 14 years ago I started what was an ongoing process for the next 4-5 years of removing most of the paper clutter in my life and either moving things to a digital format if I wanted to keep them or I just got rid of it. The first big chunk of that stuff was old financial statements. I remember finding a bank statement I had from the year I was born. I mean really was that something I needed anymore? The short answer was no as it was beyond any amount of time that I would need to look back and in addition, I had long since closed that account too <em>(that is another story of frustration with a local bank charging a poor college kid fees)</em>.</p>
<p>Now that I have moved almost all of my paper goods to digital I have realized that my digital life is kind of a mess. When I first started with a more digital approach I would just scan paper items in and save them on my computer. However, then I found Evernote and started to use that as a big repository of documents as it supported PDFs and was easy enough to organize.  However, fast forward to a couple of years ago when I got a Samsung tablet and I then thought with this handwritten support in OneNote I should move everything there. Then I moved on from <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/08/20/new-devices.html">Android</a> and went all in on iOS devices so it made sense to use a different app I quickly gravitated to the Notes app and I moved things to DayOne for archival purposes as well. However, as luck would have it at my new job I can&rsquo;t access the Apple Notes app because they block logging into iCloud and I don&rsquo;t have a Mac either which makes it more difficult. So I was on the hunt again for something that can play nice with all my devices so I have been giving Craft a try.</p>
<p>Now that we are in a new year, I am trying to figure out the best approach going forward. However, I need to break it down into some categories because as much as I would love to have everything living in one place I just don&rsquo;t think that makes sense anymore.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Kids Stuff</strong></em> - This can be anything from pictures they create at school, papers, newspaper articles about them or their team, vacation stuff they want to remember either written or spoken, and stuff from events (e.g., programs, stats, certificates).  For the last 2 years this has been kept in DayOne and I think that is the best place to keep it going forward. I have a Journal for each kid and just drop stuff in there as we go. What makes this even better is that my wife is great at documenting our travels and life by taking pictures and posting them for family and friends on Instagram. I have her account get sucked into DayOne as well so not only can we see pictures and stuff from when our kids were doing something but also the remember this day might show artwork or something else from the kids.</li>
<li><em><strong>Household / Financial Stuff</strong></em> - Broad category here as I am going to toss in receipts, anything for Taxes,  and warranties as well. Maybe this category should be broken out but in the past, both of these things have lived together in Evernote, then OneNote, and now some have started to find it&rsquo;s the way in Notes. This is the one place that has been bumped around all over the place and I am not really sure where to have it live going forward. Now that I have been using Craft more I debate putting it in there as I feel like I could create a Workspace that has just one or the other in there. However, there is the thought that I need to keep less financial stuff lately as almost all the places I use to keep an online history for more years than I need. However, I would still need a place to keep donation receipts and other miscellaneous receipts / statements as well. No real solution for myself right now but this is an area of focus for me.</li>
<li><em><strong>Work Stuff</strong></em> - This is a strange one as I don&rsquo;t really need most of this stuff long-term but I have been really struggling with where to put work notes / items to follow up on. Quick disclaimer, at my current company we use Windows machines and the Google Suite of apps. Oh, and our computers are really locked down. So where I used to take notes in OneNote for work I then was going to start up with Apple Notes but then had no way to access them at my current job. So I have found myself using Craft. The unfortunate thing here is I can not install the Windows Application but have to do everything in the web app. It is good so I am not complaining but now I have started to use a real notebook again to capture those quick things and quickly draw something out. So I am left with a really fragmented work note-keeping area. The only saving grace here is that I typically don&rsquo;t need a lot of the stuff for years. It is in the realm of writing something to quickly reference it for about a 1 year period but not after that.</li>
</ul>
<p>So not only am I trying to figure out the best way to keep things going forward the bigger part of this that isn&rsquo;t addressed is what do do with everything else. I havn&rsquo;t even started on one-off digital pictures, random files (e.g., Word, Excel, Text), and everything else that people accumulate while using computers over their lifetime. I am not sure why but it is harder for me to toss out a random document or digital item vs how quickly I was able to do it with old paper / physical stuff I had. I used to save all my financial statements and file them away in folders on my computer which now just lives on a home server. Again, most of those statements are at places I no longer have accounts or pay statements from places I don&rsquo;t work anymore (10+ years ago).</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a specific solution today but curious what others do as I attempt to get a better process as well as clean up older digital clutter in 2023.</p>

			 <p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem like it was that long ago I was talking about <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2022/11/22/rethinking-my-information.html">Rethinking my Information flow</a> and I believe I said something along the lines that I use multiple tools to kind of piece together what I want.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel like there is not a 100% solution I have seen and maybe that is where my expectations are too high or maybe what I am looking for is not what everyone else needs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Insert <a href="https://readwise.io/read">Readwise Reader</a> that just became a public beta this week. I jumped on board and actually became a paying member as I wanted to really give this a go. I think the things that really piqued my interest is that it really could be a one-stop shop for reading, and saving information. Having the integration built right into the RSS feed so that you can quickly save things for later that end up in an Inbox is kind of what I have tried to do with my various tools. Also, if I just happen to be browsing around on the web I can use their browser extensions (or iOS Apps) to save it into my queue. Then I have one place to find all of this stuff instead of finding an interesting link and putting it in a Read later service that I don&rsquo;t access enough. Or on the flip side, I access the read it later app too often because it gets out of control and I fall behind on triaging my RSS feed and eventually just mark them all as read to try to start over.</p>
<p>As you can see I am really all for this tool as it really does put pieces of my current process all in one place.</p>
<p>Now onto some of my hopes and gripes. Granted it is still in Beta and I am sure they will constantly tweak things to make everything better overall. However, here is a couple:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RSS Reader Views/Categories</strong> - The UI for the current RSS reader as it is a little clunky in my opinion. I like to bucket my RSS feeds into various things depending on what I want to catch up on (e.g., Friends' Blogs, News, YouTube Videos, Runners 😉). It isn&rsquo;t that this is not possible in Readwise Reader as you can do like I did and move things to Views. Though it is very clunky to setup as I have to touch all of my feeds again to assign them. I am sure this might be something that will change in the future but really the heavy lift will be from the initial import as I had a lot of feeds. So I guess if you are starting from scratch this would be easier. However, if Views are the way to go I would like a view that shows anything unassigned to a view as I used to use a Category like that in FreshRSS for Feeds I was kind of giving a trial before I sorted them out.</li>
<li><strong>JSON Feeds</strong> - I am really hoping they will support this because my current FreshRSS Reader doesn&rsquo;t allow for this and since I get some of my reading from Micro.blog I would like to be able to subscribe to the Discovery feed. Now that this option has been brought to my attention, I want to be able to have it in my reader of choice. <em>Thanks for the heads up on this one</em> <a href="https://micro.blog/burk"><em>Jason</em></a><em>!</em></li>
<li><strong>Dynamic OPML Feeds</strong> - This is probably not a deal breaker for me as I just started using this from Feedland. However, now that I have started to use it as a source of information I kind of like how it would pull in articles or blogs that were most read by other users in the Feedland world to my feed from time to time.</li>
<li><strong>Youtube</strong> - <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Seems like it isn&rsquo;t showing the video or a quick link to access the video but only the closed caption that YouTube generates for the video if available.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> This has now been corrected I think as of the last update and now you can actually watch videos in the iOS App or on the web without leaving the interface.</li>
<li><strong>Original Source</strong> - <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sometimes I want to get the original link to share that out and I struggle to find how I can either open the original link in the webpage to get this or just find where a link is buried. I do think this will be fixed as it isn&rsquo;t consistent how iOS does this and has good functionality vs reading on the Web to this day I have not really found how to open/share the original link. The best I have found is that I can share a Public copy of the document which would then let people see my notes / highlights which isn&rsquo;t a huge problem just not what I was looking for.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Big correction, not sure if I missed this the other day or if it was an added feature but I guess there is an Original Link in the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can tell they are constantly making changes and I am really hopeful that this will be the one place for me and I can then shutter some of the tools I currently have. Granted there is a cost associated with this after the Free Beta period and it is looking to come in at $8 per month. However, upon closer inspection of their <a href="https://readwise.io/pricing">Pricing</a> page, it looks like they might raise the price next year due to the extra value they are placing on the new Reader portion of Readwise.</p>

What they don’t show right before this is a free throw missed that could of if anything tied it up. However, looking closer at the video you will see the shooter is out of bounds and then comes back into play.  Everything happened so fast no one was the wiser. To bad that was missed but honestly, it was a great shot and impressive that they got it off in such a short time.</p>

			 <p>It was supposed to be a day to get stuff done or at least just relax as the only things we had on was something in the morning and then evening. However, we were getting some new doors delivered for the upstairs and I have someone lined up to install them on Monday. Then as a perfect storm, the delivery people dropped it off when I wasn&rsquo;t home and once I got home I found out they were not the doors I was thinking I purchased 🤦🏻‍♂️. Hoping they had made a mistake I quickly realized checking my email that I did indeed order the wrong doors. I kind of blame the store as I had everything in my online cart and then for some reason it got cleared so then I was trying to redo it and instead of getting prestained boards I got the ready-to-stain boards.</p>
<p>So this started the day off where instead of not having to do much I drove multiple loads to the store to return them and then buy the ones I could in stock. Out of 7, I was able to buy 5 of them and 2 are now coming in later as they were &ldquo;special deliver&rdquo;. The best part of those two special delivery doors is the two wrong ones that did get delivered I had to pay a 25% restocking fee&hellip; ouch! Overall I made 2 trips to the store with the incorrect doors and I was luckily (since it was only 5 of the 7) able to get those back in 1 trip at the end but might have been two if I couldn&rsquo;t have fit them all in the van.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say it was an overall waste of my resources today (time + money). I guess I at least have something for our person to install on Monday but now I am going to have to wait another week for the last two doors.</p>
<p>Even when I don&rsquo;t do the house projects myself I somehow have created a mess to deal with.</p>

			 <p>Sometimes I spend more time tinkering with things to try to get to the ideal solution than using the ones I currently have. Last night I was digging into the &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; way to consume information (e.g., blog posts, articles, news) and also how to retain the interesting parts of any of that or save the link for another point in time. I feel like there is not a 100% solution I have seen and maybe that is where my expectations are to high or maybe what I am looking for is not what everyone else needs. I don&rsquo;t mind using multiple tools to get the job done but sometimes trying to get the information from one to the next is more friction than it is worth and that is what I am trying to change. However, this is my current cobbled together parts that I am using <em>(I might even be missing something)</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://freshrss.org/"><strong>FreshRSS</strong></a> - This is really where anything I would like to subscribe to comes in and I will triage it from here (or using Reeder on iOS). It is the current firehose of information that I have cobbled even newsletters to come in through various other means. In fact, synced up <a href="http://feedland.org/">Feedland</a> feeds in there which has been interesting (more on that later).  When using just the Web version, I was able to create a quick button next to the feed item that I can send it directly to Wallabag (see below) without having to click multiple items to get it to share to it behind the scenes. I wish I could do more of these little changes as it might help my overall simplification.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag">Wallabag </a>- Really just a self-hosted read-it-later service that I like the idea of and probably won&rsquo;t remove it yet but it lacks some of the other features that I would really like in a read-it-later service or place to archive information. My biggest issue after being pointed to Matter is that the voice-to-text on this is garbage right now. If that could be improved I might try to send more stuff in this direction as it does have a really good link with my FreshRSS instance. Their iOS app isn&rsquo;t great either but I can overlook some of that if other things would work better and be more fluid.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli"><strong>Shaarli</strong></a> - Originally this was just a place to save links as a reference for later. I used it for a little while to share links I found out to Micro.blog but the one frustration was that I couldn&rsquo;t easily add a blurb or anything about it. There is a notes field but that doesn&rsquo;t translate over to get sucked into my Micro.blog. However, on the plus side, I can quickly add things to this app via the Web or iOS so I want to still use it but it has but one purpose.</li>
<li><a href="https://kill-the-newsletter.com/"><strong>Kill the Newsletter!</strong></a> - This is what I use to get newsletters into FreshRSS. I know some other apps have this built-in that I even use (i.e., Matter) but since ideally, I want everything to come into FreshRSS this was the best workaround I have found. I only have a handful that I use this for today as my preference would be to have an RSS feed from the site I subscribed to as most newsletters do today. However, this is a nice workaround for those that don&rsquo;t have that option. With that said some of the newsletters that come through don&rsquo;t look super pretty but to me it is nice to get it out of my Inbox.</li>
<li><a href="http://getmatter.com/"><strong>Matter</strong> </a>- This is a little bit newer in my arsenal of information consumption apps. I actually really like it as it does read articles really well and also offers the highlighting of text and stuff to pull out later. I think the only grip I have is that at this point it is clunky in the grand scheme of my process. <em>I get it my process should change.</em> In order for me to get information in here it seems like too many clicks from where my information comes in (e.g., FreshRSS). Matter does now support RSS but I don&rsquo;t really want a firehose of information coming into this app as it doesn&rsquo;t appear to be designed to triage information.</li>
<li><a href="http://feedland.org/"><strong>Feedland</strong></a> - Maybe this doesn&rsquo;t exactly fit in this write-up but it is something I have been using over the past two weeks since I noticed <a href="https://canion.blog/">Andrew Canion</a> posted about it. I will be honest I am not 100% sure how to use it as I probably still need to tinker with it a little more but I do like that I have a bunch of news/posts I am following that I probably would have spent the time to find. That might be one of the benefits I am seeing since one of the feeds I have in there is the most popular feed or articles of all Feedland users. Probably more to come on this at another time if I keep using it and figure it out more.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final gripe is random but it fits in the realm of RSS feeds and mostly how I consume information.  For those of you that only send excerpts in your RSS please stop! Just let the whole post be in the RSS feed so everyone can have a great reading experience and not have to go to to your site to read the rest.  I have been using <a href="https://www.fivefilters.org/full-text-rss/">FiveFilters Full-Text RSS</a>. I was using their self-hosted one for a few years now but I think it needs updating and I need to purchase a copy. I am not opposed but not sure I really need it and might just unsubscribe from those that go down the excerpt route vs allowing the RSS feed the full text 😉.</p>
<p><em>Note this was written in <a href="https://craft.do">Craft</a> and in a spider web of connected processes arrived at my Micro.blog site. Hopefully!</em></p>

			 <p>Last week Wednesday my parents dropped off this new bird feeder called a suet feeder. It took a couple of days for the birds to show up and start getting interested in it and then yesterday for some reason this squirrel was all over the suet feeder. I thought it was most amusing as I figured he can’t really get too much of the food out as there is a wire cage around the whole thing. I was working inside in the morning so I from time to time would open the deck door and scare him away.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/9431ea58f4.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Such a silly squirrel trying to get the food.. Good luck!</em></p>
<p>This went on all day and into the afternoon as I was then working from the shed I grabbed my old Canon G7X to take a photo from a distance and you can see him sitting on the feeder here 🤷‍♂️.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/28efff0efc.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Keep it up squirrel but stop wasting your time.</em></p>
<p>Later in the afternoon, I went inside to see the kids after school and as I walked up the deck and looked to my right I saw this sight below 😱😖. Oh come on, he actually opened the cage up and took the whole block of food that was in there.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/6c99d04066.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Ok you win this round squirrel, hope you enjoy the big meal.</em></p>
<p>Looks like I am going to have to rethink this feeder before I add more food to it as they obviously outsmarted me this time 😔.</p>

			 <p>A couple of weeks back we finally said goodbye to our RV as we watched drive out of our driveway for the last and final time. It was a bittersweet decision to sell as we cherish all of the memories the big beast brought our way. It won&rsquo;t be the end of our camping journey though but it is just another chapter. We decided that the kids enjoyed our seasonal campground site and it didn’t make sense to park an RV on it so we decided to settle in with a travel trailer that would give us a little more space and can just sit there year round!</p>

			 <p>After having a couple of my running friends twist my arm I finally signed up for the Twin Cities Marathon again. However, it wasn’t just because of their insistent pushing me to do it but I realized that due to COVID and not having a marathon in 2020, this is the 40th year of the Twin Cities Marathon. I <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/10/04/twin-cities-marathon.html">documented</a> how I ran it last year and before that it was 20 years ago. So it should have been the 40th running last year of the Twin Cities Marathon and that would have been even cooler to say I did it when I turned 40. However, that ship has mostly sailed but there is something neat about running both the 20th and 40th Twin Cities Marathon. I might not be as trained as last time as a lot has happened this year but I should be trained enough or at least better than I was at the 20th 😉.</p>

			 <p>Most likely the last big trip for this year has wrapped up and I am again reminded that I was going to attempt to post/record more of what happened so I would have a record of it in the future to look back on. However, as it has been almost two weeks since we got back and I haven’t posted anything from my last trip (or the first trip for that matter) except running pictures it doesn’t seem like I am going to start a new trend.</p>
<p>As I was thinking about this today I think it all comes down to I want it in chronological order on my blog and on the same day it happened. Don’t know why but that is just how my brain works. I used to be pretty good a while back at doing that and posting some daily adventures on Instagram when we road tripped to Colorado. However, I have found that harder to do over the years since then and I think some of it also comes back to having the pictures readily available to post quickly that evening. For example on this past trip to Maine, I did take a good handful of photos on my phone and it would have been probably good enough to just post that to get something of the day documented. However, I brought along our good Cannon DSLR with all of the lenses and tried my best to use it and also carried it around during the days (except when running). So I knew there were probably good photos on that too as I used it to capture moments and didn’t rely on my phone. In addition, my wife had her phone as well and took some great in-the-moment photos that I would have wanted to post as well.</p>
<p>So I waited thinking maybe the next day I would get around to doing something&hellip;. and then as the days went on I did nothing.</p>
<p>I am back to the point of wondering if I should just post a daily log that I have kept about the things we did and the places we visited. Or post the daily log and include pictures as all of them are now mostly in one place (or I can get them from my wife’s Instagram account as she does a lot better job than I). Or keep doing what I have been and doing and do nothing.</p>
<p>Time will tell but I do feel like I want a record of the event as I like looking back and seeing what we did.</p>

I probably shouldn’t have run through all the wooded areas as the last half of my <a href="http://www.strava.com/activities/7645274217">run</a> it dark out and I didn’t have lights. 🤷‍♂️ Glad the legs weren’t too beat up from yesterday.</p>

			 <p>This is long overdue but I really did enjoy my time on the Hemispheric Views podcast that was published last week titled <a href="https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/063">It&rsquo;s a Bracket!</a>.</p>
<p>I actually found some time to listen to it and it is amazing the various topics we touched on even though I was there to talk about <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/arcadia-arcade-watch-games/id1479608271">Arcadia</a> 😄. I really had a great time chatting <em>in person</em> with <a href="https://burk.io/">Jason Burk</a> (@burk), <a href="https://loungeruminator.net/">Martin Feld</a> (@martinfeld), and <a href="https://canion.omg.lol/">Andrew Canion</a> (@canion) and I want to thank each of them again for allowing me to participate. The rest of the episode after my brief appearance is great to as they continue to cover other interesting topics.

<p>So for any of you looking for a great podcast to listen to you should go check it out on your podcast player of choice or just go to their website. Don&rsquo;t base the whole show on but being biased I thought it was good!</p>

			 <p>This past weekend we went down to the Gott Family farm in small town <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie,_Iowa">Ollie, Iowa</a>. It is a little bit of a hike to get there from where we live but the kids loved every minute of it as they get to do all the things they don’t do in the cities (e.g., ride tractors, 4-wheelers, and have a personal finishing pond). I am pretty sure if you couldn’t catch a fish in this pond something is really wrong.</p>
<p>As you look though and see the size of the fish you will realize that they seemed to be well fed. Especially when the Grandkids are around.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday our dog woke up and nothing seemed off as I took her outside as I normally do. However, when we got back inside and I normally give her a treat with her daily pill in it she sniffed it and just walked away. That is not normal at all&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/eb97864848.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Doodle just looked sick as she would walk up to me while working yesterday</em></p>
<p>Fast forward a little while and she kept throwing up and then when I would take her outside she would attempt to eat more grass to throw up. We ended up calling the vet and taking her in. They were very concerned and did multiple tests which all came back good for us and later in the day she came home after some shots and we could just monitor her for the rest of the day. She only drank a little late last night but would throw up after each sip of water. The vet told us if it continued like that we should call the next morning. At midnight last night I took her out once more and she came inside and did have some water and didn’t throw up the rest of the night. I decided incase she had to go outside quick I would just sleep on the couch with her so she wouldn’t have to jump down from our big bed and walk so far to the door. Needless to say I didn’t sleep well all night as the couple of times I woke up I checked on her fearing the worst as she really hadn’t eaten or drank anything for quite some time.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/7777d70a8c.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Work up this morning and the doodle had moved around a little bit but still very tired</em></p>
<p>I took her out this morning before I went for a run and then she went back inside and slept on our bed and my wife watch over her till I got back. Once I got back I took her out again and once we got back inside she seemed a little more pep in her step and took her daily treat, ate the little bit of food I offered her and drank some water. Hopefully, things keep looking up today as I am not sure I can go though another night like that.</p>

<p>I think the other kids were quite jealous of the food I brought because she said <em><strong>everyone</strong></em> else’s parents bring this. Come to find out they all want it but no one brings it. 😆</p>
<p>It is interesting to think that she is in 1st grade and almost done with this year and I have never really been in her classroom. Some of it is she it at a different school than her siblings but also with COVID protocols the past 2 years we were never really allowed in the school much. So it was also fun for me to see where they eat lunch and the hallways she walks down every day.</p>

			 <p>I like how well the Apple AirPods just work with my iPhone. Only over the last year have I switched almost all of my personal devices back to <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/08/20/new-devices.html">Apple devices</a> and today I was reminded why it just makes sense and it just works.</p>
<p>With the upcoming weekend, I had a block of time this morning that I could get a longer than normal done during the workday. Since we are camping this weekend I wasn’t sure what the long weekend would bring.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/f8ea3bbcf9.jpg" alt="iPod Pro and iPhone 13 Mini"></p>
<p>I only got about 1.5 miles into my run this morning when I got the text (<em>that was conveniently spoken to me</em>) from our Grocery shopper that they are going to start shopping for us. <em>I am not sure why my wife put my number for them to contact but it probably works as I am in front of a computer most days and she is a teacher in front of kids.</em> However, I was able to respond easily to the shopper on her questions about substitutions for the entire run. I never had to stop once to grab my phone out and respond and I was listening to a Podcast in between the times that she would ask me another question. It was honestly just so simple to listen to what she asked me and then say “<strong>reply</strong>” and respond with my answer. I exchanged 10 messages with her until she finally sent me the note saying she was done and I would get an email shortly. This was conveniently 1 mile before I was done and I was ok with the fact that all of this happened as I was doing something else. I didn’t have much else going on during that run but I would have been frustrated if I would have had to stop every mile and try to respond to her on my phone instead of just plugging away at the miles while <em>texting</em> her back.</p>
<p>Times when technology works the way it is intended (or maybe not intended) for me just blows my mind. Some people probably would not enjoy such a disruption as I had today but I didn’t mind it at all as I might have otherwise been stuck with groceries I didn’t want or ones I would have happily taken a replacement for but never responded to say so.</p>

			 <p>This book was just <strong>awesome</strong>! I had been looking for a book to read and this one dropped into my lap at the right time.</p>
<p>I have been a big fan of Eliot’s books in the past and this one again is not a disappointment and somehow seems to take it to the next level.</p>
<p>Due to a busy schedule of kids' activities, it took me a while to actually pick up <a href="https://eliotpeper.com/books/reap3r">Reap3r</a> and start reading it but once I did I could not put it down. The bite-sized chapters and fast-paced book kept me wanting to read more and find out what happened and unfolded next.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/9fb2a72db8.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Well, what more can I say that you should go pick up a copy when it is <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reap3r-Eliot-Peper-ebook/dp/B09PZNWKGQ">released on May 18th</a></strong>. Eliot does it again by doing a great job of keeping the book relevant enough in today&rsquo;s world in both technology, political, and environmental issues that help make a near future book seems believable and real. With out spoiling too much some of the things he brings up in the book is crazy to think he wrote those parts more than 2 years before publishing and some of the ideas and thoughts he put in the book came true 😳. I think that is why I love his books so much. No matter how fast-paced or near future he makes the books they don’t feel that far out on the horizon of technology and the issues seem like they might be something we will need to address in our lifetime.</p>
<p>The story has many key characters that each have their own stories and at the start, you keep trying to figure out how everything is going to fit together. That is where the magic of his writing takes place as he weaves each of the characters' stories together. There are past friendships / acquaintances with secrets to hide which is how they ended up where they are today. Then there are newer characters that have created something amazing and are now being thrust into the mix and trying to put all the pieces together.</p>
<p>Not to mention Eliot&rsquo;s attention to detail throughout the book I always appreciate as I can picture the places he is talking about and it makes me feel like I am there seeing the sights and sounds. Also, how can I forget if you have read some or all of Eliot’s books you might find some tie-ins or mentions of technology, and/or people from his previous works 😉.</p>
<p>Thanks again to my friend Eliot for providing me with an advanced copy of your book as I thoroughly enjoyed it. In fact, I enjoyed it so much that I noticed that there will be an Audiobook version that he will be doing the reading for so I have already reserved a copy of that to accompany me on some long runs in the future.</p>
<p><em>As I mentioned I have read some of Eliot&rsquo;s books before and wrote about them so if you are interested to check out some of his other books go for it as you won&rsquo;t be disappointed! Here are a couple: <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2020/05/28/veil-by-eliot.html">Veil</a>, <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2017/06/23/true-blue-a.html">True Blue (A Short Story)</a>, <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2018/04/01/bandwidth-by-eliot.html">Bandwidth</a>, <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2020/05/28/veil-by-eliot.html">Borderless</a>, and <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/05/breach-by-eliot-peper.html">Breach</a>.

<p>The night before the girls wanted to decorate the house like we do for their birthdays so I agreed to this but needed the help to get it all done!

I believe we had basketball stuff, horse party favors, and 40th birthday decorations that were modified for this year.</p>

			 <p>Another trip around the sun for me as I flip my internal digits to <strong>41</strong>! As I am sitting down in these morning hours, hoping the kids will sleep in longer as they are on Spring Break, I am actually struggling what to write. It isn’t that I don’t know what to write but there was actually a lot of things that happened and I know I won’t capture them all or well enough in this entry. I am still working from home for the most part which is a blessing some days and a curse other times.</p>
<p>However, using past entries as a guide I will follow up on some things I alluded to last year and just talk about other things.</p>
<p>Year two with the RV was much like the first but a little less camping this year as we didn’t know what to expect with kids camps and stuff coming back. We never made it on a real long roadtrip but we visited a couple new places and old ones. I will say even though it is a chore getting the rig ready and cleaned out it seems like once we are at a place everyone enjoyed their time.</p>

<em>Lainey Lou the Doodle loves camping and her favorite camp chair&hellip; Sorry humans!</em></p>
<p>It was my 40th this past year I had some big things planned in the area of running&hellip;. The good thing is I did complete the <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/10/04/twin-cities-marathon.html">Twin Cities Marathon</a> that I did 20 years ago that day which was just a fun accomplishment in my mind.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/924e8a2dbb.jpg" alt=""><br>
<em>My crew really supported me the whole way with cheers.. I loved it!</em></p>
<p>However, the second thing I had up my sleeves didn’t pan out which might have been for the best. I would have had limited time in between each event so it might have made that Marathon extra hard. However, I decided to embark on my own adventure of a 4x4x40 which I then decided to complete the entire <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/21/xx-recap.html">4x4x48</a> (which involves running 4 miles ever 4 hours for 48 hours).</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/c28aac39d4.jpg" alt=""><br>
<em>Doing a 4x4x48 means sometimes you find yourself running at night in the snow/rain. It’s fun right?</em></p>
<p>It was one of those fun accomplishments that I was doing for myself and no one knew but me so that made it all the more fun. Kind of like when I ran a <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/09/30/k-a-day.html">5k a day for 365 days</a> as no one really knew much about it till the end. It wasn’t that I was hiding it but it was something that I wanted to prove to myself just like the 4x4x48. I am not really sure what this year will bring as I haven’t signed up for anything but I keep plugging along. If anything I am going to keep exploring as a good thing about being able to run further from my house is I find new places to explore.</p>

<em>Following some new to me paths in the Riley Creek Conservation Area</em></p>
<p>As I looking forward to this next year, I am looking forward to traveling again. We have a couple trips in the works for the summer that should be really fun. One with the RV and the other just flying somewhere. As a family we haven’t flew anywhere for such a long time. Additionally, I need to work some more on my “Project Shed” to get it in a better place to work before summer when the kids are at home every day.</p>
<p>I don’t think I did much around “Learning” this past year and for the life of me I am not sure what I was going to do. I guess silly as it is I learned (re-learned) how to be a longer distance runner but I don’t think that is what I was thinking. This year I am still going to focus on other aspects of <strong>“Embracing”</strong> which has been kind of an ongoing one but more around Embracing moments. I think being kind of locked up for the last two years (which it was good to be safe) has led me to not be as outgoing as I was and I know that needs to change slightly. I think there should be some easy wins here but just need to make the <em>time</em> and <strong>commitment</strong> to do it. Probably part putting myself out there again after all this time at home 😁.</p>

			 <p>Wow! All four games over the weekend were down to the wire last second buzzer beater games! The point differential in total was 8 (2,2,3,1 in that order). Proud of their team for not giving up as most of the games we came back from 8-10 points down but they played tough and didn’t give up. I am pretty sure all of us adults aged a bit more after those games.</p>
<p>My wife and I couldn’t attend the final 2 games on Sunday as we were at a Dance Competition for our two girls. A big thanks to to Papa Walker (my Dad) for being our in-person cheer squad while we watched via livestream from the girls’ dance competition. <em>(Apologies to the dancers on stage as our group let out an audible cheer at the buzzer beating victory!!! 🙉)</em></p>

<p>What a great way to end the season and it is sad that the season has now come to an end. It has been fun watching these boys play together. They had a very successful season (28-12) despite all the sicknesses, and injuries. As I was the official / unofficial stat keeper here are some interesting facts.</p>
<ul>
<li>1st Place in 3 tournaments</li>
<li>2nd Place in 2 tournaments</li>
<li>3rd Place in 1 tournaments</li>
<li>40% shooting percentage vs opponents 35%</li>
<li>One tournament they only had 5 kids to play (no subs) and only lost one game</li>
<li>Out of the 40 games only two kids were at all of them (one being my son)</li>
</ul>

			 <p>I have been collecting this data and been reading articles for some time about the discrepancies in my <strong>Apple Watch 6 vs my Garmin fēnix 5x</strong>. However, I have not finished all of that yet and felt compelled to post this quickly as I ran across a very puzzling issue today that I am not even really sure where to start but this is how it went.</p>
<p>On my run today I started both watches at the same time as always waiting for the Apple Watch to do it’s 3 second countdown and then I hit start on my Garmin. Today was colder out so I had a jacket over both watches so to that point I only looked once at both watches to see how the time was as I knew I needed to make a loop (or thought I did) because I wasn’t going to hit the mileage I was shooting for. However, the Apple Watch was back at the main screen and not in the Workout screen. This is only irritating as I had to type in my pin to get into the watch. I thought for sure then it must have stopped timing but this had also happened earlier in the week and once I clicked back into the Workout app I could see the time was still ticking away. I did the same thing today and glanced that it was still running but didn’t look close enough to know what the time said or anything.</p>
<p>Fast forward 1 more mile and I was at the end of my run and I stopped my Garmin first and then went to my wrist and stopped the Apple Watch as I always do. However, looking at the activity summaries I noticed the Apple Watch said I only ran a fraction of the time and distance I knew I was at.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/ea3d6c2048.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Now I have had some discrepancies before now but never such a big one</em></p>
<p>Knowing that didn’t seem right I dug into the details of the Apple Watch the GPS shows me stopping this half way through the run 🤔. I would say oh it must have just shut off but I know with 1 mile to go I looked at it and the time was ticking away so if anything where was that portion of time.</p>
<h3 id="i-gotta-have-the-details">I gotta have the details&hellip;</h3>
<p>Now as a person running with two watches I get I am a little strange but this was even more boggling than the research I have been looking into on just GPS accuracy for each watch. So I looked at some more of the details and found a couple interesting points.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/536c970837.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Garmin fēnix 5x</em></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/0a42211841.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Apple Watch 6</em></p>
<p>You can see that both the Garmin and Apple Watch have the same start and stop times so I was correct at seeing the time clicking away when I had to re-enter my pin with 1 mile to go. However, that only goes to being more odd as the Apple Watch says the total time was 21:18 (head scratcher I know). Also, it says it didn’t have enough data for my Heart Rate. Something wasn’t working right the whole time because I would think even for a 2.5 mile run that would give it enough and I wear the watch pretty snug so it isn’t like it bounces around when I run. I guess Apple didn’t think I my <em>”effort”</em> was enough to be recorded for at least the last 3.7 miles but really the whole thing for HR perspective.</p>
<p>Hopefully, I will get to finishing my post around the GPS accuracy at some point but it probably won’t be any silver bullet as shockingly there is a lot of information but maybe only a couple good explanations. Until then I will hold off my true thoughts on both I will keep wearing them 😆. ⌚️ ⌚️</p>

		<a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2022/03/03/getting-organized.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-03-03 11:11:25 -0600">Mar 3, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I am not completely there yet but it seems a lot of my other projects as of lately have revolved around this idea of organizing things&hellip;</p>
<p>This probably started back in early January when I went down the rabbit hole of getting all my old DVDs on a computer to use with Plex as a way to free up some shelf space in the basement. I don’t remember the last time we have used any of those DVDs except a very small handful we take along in the RV. However, since putting them all on the computer, I think we have watched 10 movies off there so far. The next step in this process was getting a better handle on our Picture organization too, it aligned nicely with the first project because we had to get more HD space and in that purchase, we got a <em>new</em> computer so everything needed to be transferred from the old drive. With the new computer, the nice advantage is I have been able to remotely log into it and it is fast enough that I could look through old stuff and organize other things to fit with the process we use now. In fact, our picture process has even changed since I first had thought about it so maybe I will expand on that at another time.</p>
<p>Online organization, this I have written about before but I have really abandoned using my old blog / Instagram / Twitter and have doubled down on Mico.blog. I am happy with this change as I like everything in one place but I do find at times I might be over clutter the M.b timeline when I do some multiple posts from a weekend adventure. I like to toss a photo up to capture moments which is why a while back I mostly only used Instagram. I am still using it today but now I only use the app to follow some friends of mine that don’t really post anywhere else.</p>
<p>The next endeavor might take me a little longer to get done but I want to find the right tool or process to help me get more organized or stay organized. The issue is that I have realized a lack of organization in my life over the last year but probably has been a little longer than that. I hate to admit it, maybe it is an easy excuse but I think it has something to do with working from home and without having that separation and maybe a dedicated office space for non-work tasks, stuff has been blended together and I have not found a good way to reconcile all of it. There is also a lot of other things that have changed in my process over this time as well. I moved away from Evernote, which kept everything, to OneNote for some information and Day One for others. Additionally, once I completely ditched all my Android devices for iOS in 2021 (wow big purchase year), I then moved a little bit from OneNote into using more Apple Notes. So my storage of things is pretty fragmented right now as well and I think that is causing me panic as I don’t have a great system at this time.</p>
<p><strong><em>More to come&hellip;</em></strong></p>

			 <p>I spent more time that I like to admit thinking about using a Read it Later service I ran across called <a href="https://www.wallabag.it/en">Wallabag</a> only to on a wim sign up for a trial subscription. However, I never got an email to log into it which was super frustrating and then I was about ready to just setup the service on my own server as that is an option. However, I wanted to trial their service and who know maybe I would have just paid for it as it wasn’t that expensive. Long story short, I realized not recieving the email was 100z5 my fault because when I moved a domain over to Porkbun I didn’t setup the email forwarding right 🤦‍♂️. After getting that fixed, I decided to try to login to Wallabag again and see what this Read it Later service was all about.</p>
<p>Honestly, in the 2 min I used it and set up the Chrome Extension I had this feeling that I didn’t want it and probably would not use it anyways 😁. I think I realized again that anything I would stick in the <em>Read it Later</em> tool I would <strong>NEVER</strong> read later. It would just be a place of notes and I already have enough apps and tools that do that.</p>
<p>The closest I have come to using a Read It Later service on a more frequent basis was when I piped in RSS feeds directly to them and that was where I would just go read everything. My only issue with that was it wasn’t easy to just clear it out and declare RSS bankruptcy (which I do from time to time). Also, it came back to what would I do after I read an article do I archive it or delete it? I never went back and looked at prior saved articles and part of that is if I really wanted to remember something or retain something from what I read I would probably put it in a notes app.</p>
<p>So, after checking out another Read it Later service I am still back to not using a Read it Later service and I am ok with that. I did really like the name of the service though, in fact it could have been catchy&hellip; <strong>Wallabag.it</strong></p>

<p>Just a normal <a href="http://www.strava.com/activities/6688606301">run</a> until I had to help rescue this dog that escaped its owner. When I found the dog no one was in sight. After I finally got the dog to me the owner showed up from down the street. All is right again.</p>

			 <p>This is something I should have done years ago honestly. However, as I have been moving more stuff to the old computer I used to use for some of my most recent <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2022/01/21/down-the-rabbit.html">projects</a>. I realized that it was very slowwwww&hellip; In fact, slow enough that now with the new to me Mac Mini up and running I can finally connect to it remotely and go through all my old files and not get frustrated and walk away. Finally it will be more than just a dumping ground that I never wanted to touch and might have some real <strong>order</strong>. To be clear, the old one did a great job of just backing up what was on it and the HD connected to it but other than that trying to log in and do something was a huge pain.</p>
<p>A couple weeks back I got this idea and saw a great deal for a used Mac Mini Late 2014 2.6GHz Dual Core i5. I decided to consulting with my new go to tech person, who gave it a thumbs up in agreement so I pulled the trigger. Not sure if he was just trying to get me to buy more Apple devices or if he really believed it was going to be better for me🤷‍♂️. Either way, fast forward to earlier this week and it is fully setup and functioning. I am so happy with the setup and it takes up such a smaller footprint than the iMac 24-in early 2008, 2.8Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo 😱.</p>
<p>A big thanks again to <a href="https://burk.io">Jason Burk</a> for helping me figure out how to set all this stuff up in the best way possible. In fact right now I am connected to it on my iPad from my kids school analyzing some horrifying results of <a href="https://setapp.com/apps/gemini">Gemini</a> in the amount of duplicate photos I have <em>(note I am trying it out via Setapp)</em>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I am not sure how this happened but I have gone down what I will call the rabbit hole of projects lately by having too many and all of them are in flight right now. Each will be great when they are done and all serve different purposes. Here they are in somewhat a specific order of events:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Micro.blog</strong> - I got this idea finally to try making Micro.blog my home for all Posts, and Pictures. This involved rolling up my old Website and then importing my Instagram photos. Both of the projects are “Done” in theory. However, there is a lot more clean-up than I anticipated so this will be an ongoing project for a while. I thought I had the website import done and cleaned up but now that I am still working on the Instagram stuff I am finding more that did not come through due to the issues I outlined in that <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2022/01/05/all-in-on.html">post</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Plex.tv</strong> - I got this installed on an old Mac I have stashed away in the basement after hearing it come up from time to time in conversations from others. My first thought was to use it as an easier way to access Pictures and Videos I had stored on a central storage device in my house. We store all of our pictures and videos there (which is then backed up to Backblaze) but sometimes getting them back or finding them again is not as easy as it should be. File sharing is slow to display previews and standing in the laundry room to use the computer isn’t ideal either. So I have only added at this point the 2021 photo library we have as the scan on this old thing takes a while and I also need this computer to do other work <em>(see below)</em></li>
<li><strong>DVDs</strong> (Part 1) - I got this crazy idea to clean out this DVD shelf that has too many DVDs of which never get used but you can see it in the background of all my WebEx calls. I realized that I could just box them up and put them away but some of them I realized I don’t have digitally and now that my kids are getting older I might want to watch with them. Unfortunately, before I started to box any of these up my wife reminded me that we do use the DVDs sometimes when we go Camping since streaming is not an option. Sometimes it is nice to have some on hand as a backup when it rains. Hoping there was a way to figure this all out I was reminded of an article from fellow Micro.blog friend Jason Burk describing how he created the <a href="https://burk.io/2021/creating-the-golden-set">Golden Set</a> by converting his DVDs to MP4s. <strong>BINGO</strong> now I had a project. *Current status is after a couple trial and errors, I have done about 150 of our DVDs and I feel like I have a long way to go.</li>
<li><strong>DVDs</strong> (Part 2) - Due to some of the trial and errors of the first project I dug out an old computer I had gotten long ago. Come to find out it would be the perfect DVD machine but I realized that it did not have windows on it and that sent me down a path of digging through old CDs to find some sort of Windows CDs from past systems. I did find an old copy of Windows 8 which was working fine until I couldn’t seem to get any updates to fix the mouse drivers and whatnot. The solution was going to be to buy Windows 10 (which I wasn’t excited about) but I found out I was eligible for a free Windows 10 upgrade. That all worked well but it took some time to get to that point.</li>
<li><strong>Storage</strong> 🤦‍♂️&hellip; As you work through the above projects you can only guess this leads to the question of do you have enough storage for all of these DVDs that you are going to now make digital? The answer is NO.. No, I do not. However, this was going to be an issue before this project took off as a couple of months ago I realized my 4TB HD was getting within 100GB of reaching the end of its life. To me, that is too close. <em>I need to still figure this out in the meantime I had a 2TB removable drive that I am currently putting all the movies on after I pull them off the DVDs. However, I don’t want this to last too long as they are not getting backed up to Backblaze and that would be a pain to have to do it all over again.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Well hopefully some of these projects come to completion this week or throughout the next couple of weeks but I am sure they will drag on much longer than that.</p>

			 <p>Another step in migrating a lot of my stuff in one place has been completed. I wish I could say this was a super simple process that took an hour or less and was done. However, due to some <strong>user</strong> confusion, it took me more hours than I would like to add up. I was probably trying to do too many tasks at once but I ended up uploading a lot of duplicates which then required me to click into each Uploads page and Posts page and remove said duplicates 🤦‍♂️. Now in theory I would not have had to do this as it would only annoy anyone flipping through old posts but seeing how that for sure will be me it would annoy me and now seemed like the best time to clean it up before it really annoys me in the future <em>(future Eric better thank me)</em>.</p>
<p>Thinking back there are probably two things I should have done differently or paid closer attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Really understand what and how things were going to get pulled over to Micro.blog. I know it was said many times in what I had read on the post about it but I kind of forgot that I had a bunch of Instagram posts where I had 10 pictures in each. They were when we were traveling and I did a daily recap of our days. So&hellip; that then created 10 M.b posts that really require clean up as it also didn&rsquo;t pull over the caption for one or any of the 10 pictures.</li>
<li>Do smaller bathes of photos and remember to clear the selection after it is uploaded. I think this is where my duplicates came into place. I think I would start selecting the next batch before the first finished. So when I then clicked Import the next time some were duplicated.</li>
<li>Hashtags - Wow this seems like a fun idea when you are using Instagram but it is really a pain when you import all of them and you have a ton of hashtags for a photo. Now I should say, it looked fine but I just couldn’t live with myself having the hashtags that were of really no use to me in my new setup. This is one of those times I wish I could just do a find an replace. 😆</li>
<li>Emoji’s - Not sure why but theses didn’t really come though all the time. Some many times they were garbled. I guess it would have been good again to check this first but I think in my earlier or later times on Instagram I didn’t use them as much as I did at one time.</li>
</ul>
<p>I should say even though I had some frustration cleaning up the issues from the import. I don&rsquo;t really blame the program as it was really my own mistake in not fully paying attention or understanding.</p>
<p>One interesting thing I did find when going back though and cleaning up the pictures, there was a time that I posted some of the same things to my old blog as I did Instagram. As of now I kept them both there. I know I need to do some more cleanup so when that time comes I might remove some of them.</p>
<p><strong>Next up&hellip;</strong> I don’t know if there is much else left to bring into M.b. I have some other older sites that my wife and I used when we went to Peru and then when our son was born 6 weeks early. Those two were merged many years ago and then it was more or less a family site that we kept updating with pictures of the kids. However, each year that goes by we use it less and less and I am pretty sure we didn’t use it at all last year. If I decided to bring it in, I think it would only be parts and I would need to go back and make sure all is fixed before I do that as I don’t want to cause more problems for myself 😆.</p>

			 <p>I can’t say for sure this will be my final solution but it has made sense so far. A little while ago that I wanted to give this a try as I don’t like having too many different places on the internet to hold where my stuff is. I had been stuck for a while thinking of a new domain name and in the meantime I bought about 10 (yikes!). Maybe I will point some of them to some specific stuff on Micro.blog but my main one now for this domain is going to just be <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog">EricMWalk.blog</a>. I think I will make a simple static site that my EricMWalk.com can be pointed to and there I can point people to other projects I have worked on. However, right now it just goes to my old WordPress blog so still need to get that changed.</p>
<p>So I finally did it and moved all of my old posts from my self hosted WordPress blog to Micro.blog so I would have finally one source of information <em>(well not exactly more on that later)</em>. Overall the import process in Micro.blog worked flawlessly except, I did find some issues but they were self inflicted for many reasons. The one I assumed I would run into was any links I had in my posts to other posts on my site which would not get updated correctly. I was right on that but luckily I didn’t have too many posts with that issue and I could correct that problem somewhat quickly by doing a search in the Micro.blog post section for my old site name. However, the two bigger unknowns to me that I probably should have expected but didn’t think about were having too many tags and that pictures didn’t import.</p>
<p>Tags - This was nightmare. I guess though the years on WordPress I got very Tag happy as it didn’t seem hard to just add them as you went and honestly I probably didn’t use them too much but to find related things or maybe others did. However, all of them got imported into Micro.blog and I quickly realized that my one off tags were very messy. So I went though and painfully deleted as many as I could. I still have more than I like but it was a good start to see how I can use tags going forward. I think the interesting thing for tags in Micro.blog is that they are their own feeds so I might do something with that at some point.</p>
<p>Pictures <em>(Root Cause - Old Domain Names 🤦‍♂️)</em> - This is a problem of having various domain names over the years. Micro.blog did an exactly what it was suppose to do and did an excellent job importing the photos to Micro.blog when it could “find” the photos. However, since some of the domains I don’t have anymore I had broken links on my WordPress site that I had not really realized so Micro.blog couldn’t find the photo to import. I am not sure if there is a quicker way to fix it on the Micro.blog side of things but honestly if I would have maybe thought about this before I exported everything I more than likely could have cleaned it up to make it work more seamlessly.</p>
<p>Other than those two minor hiccups I am glad to have gone full in on Micro.blog and with that I am hoping to be posting more photos, thoughts, and other things I find interesting all in one spot.</p>
<h4 id="next-up">Next up&hellip;</h4>
<p>Since I have not been using Facebook (forever really), and Instagram has been less and less. I stoped really posting to Facebook specifically a long time ago and just did instagram and my WordPress blog but since the beginning of 2021 I have been really using Micro.blog to post the quick photos I would have done there. So next up I am thinking of pulling all of my historic Instagram posts to Micro.blog after I ran across this <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/import-from-instagram/77">help post</a>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Two weeks ago I decided to set off on completing a <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/01/xx-running-challenge.html">4x4x40</a> as part of some crazy ideas for my 40th birthday year. However, after I reached the 40 miles I felt like I really needed to continue as I figured at that point I might never do this again and get so close to hitting the real number and completing a 4x4x48 (run 4 miles every 4 hours for 48 hours). Maybe it helped that I was a bit sleep deprived at the time and not thinking clearly as I figured what was two more 4 mile runs at that point.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/d0d7eda4b0.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Since I posted after each of my runs with a short photo, time, and thought I will not rehash all of them. I don’t want to make light of this challenge as I think it was hard but the miles themselves weren’t the worst for me. Some of that could have been that I didn’t really have a pace per mile in mind. I obviously wasn’t going to try to run the fastest 4 miles I could every time. However, in my mind, I wanted to keep all of my averages per run under 9 min/miles. The biggest struggle for me during this challenge was trying to fit it in during a normal working day. Due to the weather forecast and maybe my last-minute planning, as it was December, I did it during the middle of a workweek. So I scheduled it out earlier in the week and pretty much created an appointment for myself every 4 hrs. It worked great the first day but the second day some things came up at work so I had to shrink down one of my 3 hr blocks of <em>recovery</em> and extend other ones. I still was able to get the run in that 4 hr bock but I wasn’t as consistently on the hour as I was the first day of running. In a way, I am wondering if working both days helped me keep my focus away from running and how tired I might have been as I was doing things I needed to do during the day. Then in the evenings I still helped get the kids to activities and stuff.</p>
<p>Now obviously the lack of sleep is one thing but the worst time of runs for me was the 5am runs that I did. I think it is because after the late-night 1am run it always took me longer than anticipated to fall asleep. You would have thought I would have been tired enough to just get into the house and fall asleep. I am guessing that the kick of adrenaline that was in my body messed with allowing my brain to shut down at that time. So for both days by the time I would will myself to sleep and it would work I think I only got 1 hr before I would have to wake up at 5am to run. After that run, I would just start my day and didn’t try to get any more rest as my youngest gets on the bus at 7am.</p>
<p>In the end, I have never run so many miles in two days. It ended up being 48.9 miles due to one run when I put my trust in a running friend who lead me astray by an extra mile. Those two days were more mileage than I had completed any week during my marathon training this past year. It was an interesting challenge as it took careful planning as I still worked and helped with kid activities like a normal day. It was just I ran every 4 hrs 😁. The day after I was done I felt pretty wiped out from most likely lack of sleep and over-exercise. Fast forward two weeks later and I am back on track. Maybe I will do another one of these challenges someday but probably no time soon. At least for the rest of this year, it will be back to the normal scheduled running for me.<br>

<p>Less sleep in between than I hoped, my wife woke up not feeling well. So I did what I could to help her get. I think I got 1hr of sleep but it is not easy at this hour to shut the mind down.</p>

			 <p>Earlier this year I had a plan to run 40 miles with a really good friend of mine through the mountains of Colorado. We thought it would be fun to run 40 miles since we both turned 40 this year. Not to mention suffering together and probably laughing along the way made it seem like a feat that could be pushed through to accomplishment. The timing was not going to be great for me as it was one month before my <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/10/04/twin-cities-marathon.html">Twin Cities Marathon</a> but I was game to do it as it sounded amazing. Honestly, I wasn’t even sure how to train for such a thing but I just said yes and he said he would work out the details. The bummer is around May he hurt his ankle and knew the run wouldn’t happen. I was bummed that it fell apart but it probably worked out since I hadn’t run a marathon for 20 years and I wasn’t sure what I was in for. I am sure it probably wouldn’t have been great to come in not feeling the best from a 40 mile run through the mountains no matter how long it took us.</p>
<p>Fast forward to about 1 month before I ran the marathon and I stumbled across this concept of running 4 miles every 4 hours for 48 hours. At the time I didn’t know anything about it but thought that had a nice ring to it. However, the whole 48 hrs didn’t mesh with my goal so I figured I would modify it slightly to fit as a <strong><em>4x4x40</em></strong> instead 😁.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4 miles every 4 hours for 40 hours since I am 40 this year</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That leads me up to now&hellip; After the <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/10/04/twin-cities-marathon.html">marathon</a>, I have been trying to take it easy and just running for pleasure but I feel like I have been missing something as I had hoped to do something else with this <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/03/24/forty.html">year 40</a>. After pondering this for the last month, I realized that if I am going to do it I need to do it before it gets too cold in the night to complete this task so I am going to start tonight (or today) and we will see how this goes.</p>
<p>I do know more about the real 4x4x48 challenge and the guy who created it. However, my goal still has not changed. I will probably write about it as I go mostly just to document it along the way so I apologize to anyone not interested in this disregard my posts for at least more than 40 hrs from the first. Then we will be back to our regularly scheduled posting.</p>
<p>I don’t have any main goals in mind if you are wondering. My goal is probably to do as many of these 4x4s that I can in hopes to get to 40 but that is a lot of mileage for me in a short amount of time. Also, I am not concerned about my pace either except hoping I don’t go too fast at any point as that could screw things up. Either way, this is going to be an interesting experiment no matter how many I get done so we will see how it goes!</p>
<p>A final note for those interested, I am still working and getting kids to school and activities. So I am kind of treating this as just some breaks throughout my day and that is another reason why this time lined up perfectly. In the perfect world, I would only be doing this 40hrs with no other responsibilities. 🤷‍♂️</p>

			 <p>Brecken has been begging us to go family bowling since he has started in this junior League every that plays every Saturday. With his new ball finally ready it seemed like the right time for a Sunday morning family fun. Can’t beat the prices at Tuttles for $2.50 per game so we got there early and had a late breakfast while we bowled for a couple hours. Everyone seemed to enjoy doing something different but I think the third game might have been a little too much. With our family of 5 it took us about 1 hr to bowl a game but everyone powered through even with some touch and go moments at some times 😁.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Prompted from an episode of <a href="https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/041">Hemispheric Views</a> where they brought up this subject of Nostalgic November where you would share a memory of anything from your past that brings a smile to your face. I hadn’t thought much of it since I listened to the episode but all of a sudden over the last couple of days I realized things I was doing, researching, or even talking about have been reminding me of something from my youth.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/11aab6df29.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="trains-"><strong>Trains&hellip; 🚂</strong></h2>
<p>That is right, trains. I have always had this interest / fascination with trains which at some point also lead me to model trains when I was younger. I am not sure when it ever first started but it could have been a visit to the Henry Ford Museum as a kid, or watching trains go by the train tracks at the end of the street, or maybe from my walks home from school or when my friend and I would go exploring train bridges and walk along the tracks near our houses, or it could just be they are huge machines and as a kid that is really cool! I am not sure when my interest in trains finally led me to model trains but when that happened I remember being interested all over again as it was something I could purchase, build, and tinker with all the extra electronics.</p>
<p>Over the years, I stopped getting more model train stuff and boxed everything up when I went to college. After college, there was a brief time when I lived with my brother and I got really into it again and started buying engines and other parts as a local store was going out of business. However, once I moved away to Chicago that obsession stopped again. Once I moved back to Minnesota and we had younger kids I set up the track and got all the trains out a couple of times but even then that has now passed. They are now sitting in a box high up in the closet of our basement craft room. Maybe someday I will bring them down and set them up again.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/432e6aabab.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>One thing is for sure, anytime I find myself running on an old Rail Trail, crossing train tracks to get somewhere, visiting places with old train Depots, or even thinking about how I used to walk home from school. All of those experiences trigger memories of when I was younger.</p>

			 <p>Todays running adventure in the light snow fall was finding a new trail. Or that is what I thought I had stumbled upon… Come to find out I was wrong. So after jumping through the tall grass for a while I gave up and turned around. 🌨🏃🏻‍♂️</p>
<p>Do you see a trail?🤦‍♂️</p>

			 <p>Decided to follow a <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/6267437384">trail</a> with 6 tunnels yesterday along the 3.4 mile <a href="https://onthegomap.com/s/t0pshhke">Bluff Creek Local Trail</a> in Chanhassen 🏃🏻‍♂️</p>

<p>Then I actually found the end of the trail so I turned around and ran back to my car 😁. I had actually never run on this trail before so even though the map said it was going to end sometimes things aren’t updated that well and I was thinking it might have gone further. So it did surprise me when I came to the end and the path did not go further or connect up to anything else. I am guessing it is because if they wanted to keep extending it South they would have to figure out how to go over or under HWY-212.</p>
<p>Overall, it was really nice trail that was all asphalt so I might have to remember this one for next summer with the kids as the distance isn’t to crazy either.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong>: Since I didn’t post this yesterday as planned, I dug into some of the old Chanhassen park records and it seems like the Master Park / Trail plans from 2017 and 2018 assumed they would continue it further South. I wonder if once the construction of HWY-212 was completed they just abandoned the original plan or maybe didn’t leave a passage to get under it. I did notice that the HWY was on the original plans but based on what I know it wouldn’t have been completed at that time and was still a work in progress. Additionally, the details of their plan never really addressed how it was going to get past that HWY like other referenced markings on the plan to show an existing bridge or tunnel.</em></p>

			 <p>Back when I was a long time Fitbit user, I used to have a scale from them as well so all of my fitness information was in once place. In fact, from time to time I would keep track of foods I ate in the Fitbit app as well and it worked pretty well overall.</p>
<p>However, as time has passed I got <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/10/08/goodbye-fitbit.html">frustrated with Fitbit</a> and it’s lack of durability from my point of view and move to a Garmin. I still used my Fitbit scale until it broke not long after but also my wife had bought one of those <a href="myshapa.com">Shapa scales</a> that was about the worst type of scale out there. Sorry, I am sure it works for some people but for me I could care less what color I had I just wanted to know my actual weight in lbs 😆. I did figure out how I could get a number by having the information shared with Google Fit and then I could just manually put it into my Garmin Connect app. I hate to say I did that for longer than I would like to have admitted before I got tired of doing the manual part and just donated the scale as no one else was using the piece of garbage anyways.</p>
<p>That brings me to today as I would like to keep track of my weight again as well as try to track my calorie intake. I am trying to figure out the best route to take here and am open to suggestions. Ideally, I would like a single app that could pull all of this information together as a one stop shop. I know I could buy a normal scale and enter the information manually but for me I want to set a routine of standing on the scale and not make notes to myself to record it in a system. I just want it to be automatic! Kind of like the Fitbit did for me before but since I don’t have a Fitbit watch that seems kind of silly for that and I have found nothing plays super nice with Garmin Connect. Ideally, it would be something that can send data to or pull information from Garmin Connect or Apple Health.</p>
<p><em>Any suggestions send them my way please!</em></p>

			 <p>I really can’t believe that I found my Apple Pencil late yesterday. As I kept thinking about it I was trying to remember what was around me at the table where I was working the day before. The problem is everything had gotten moved around as well as the kids dumped all of their Halloween candy out to sort through so I had to think about what was there the day before. I looked all over the floor and around the area thinking maybe it rolled off or got attached to the metal under the table or on the chairs. Also, we have a new coffee bar that has metal doors on it so I thought maybe it attached itself to that. Finally, while looking at that I saw the new black metal baskets my wife bought for us and I remembered how my daughter got some white ones as well. So I walked back to her room and sure enough as you can see it attached itself to the metal white basket that she showed me before she moved it back to her room. I am still surprised that I found it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>It has been so long since I have actually logged into and looked around at my WordPress powered <a href="https://upnorth.blog">UpNorth.blog</a> site that I realized so much stuff is outdated.</p>
<p>Right now I push all the content from Micro.blog there as it was how I set it up a year ago and I actually don’t mind the process flow. Nothing that gets pushed over there is published to the front page unless I want it to be and have to log in to make it happen. Otherwise all of these posts are kind of hidden in the background. I know if you really wanted to find it you could but you might have to dig a little or know what to search for. There has only been a couple times in the past year that I have taken a post I published on Micro.blog and made sure it hit the main page of that site.</p>
<p>As I keep looking at the couple of site pages I have, I found my about page hadn’t been updated for 4 years as it talked about some work I did with a different non-profit. Also, I realized I had a newsletter subscribe and archive link there that I haven’t even sent anything out since 3 years ago as well.</p>
<p>I guess I am trying to figure out the purpose of this site as anything I want to share or post I publish to my Micro.blog site. I don’t really need a professional site of any kind so it is almost a backup of my Micro.blog which isn’t the end of the world but I have been thinking about changing things up again.</p>
<p>Uh oh&hellip; 😁</p>

			 <p>I believe today marks my one year of using Micro blog or at least based on my post from a year ago <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2020/10/13/new-day-new.html">today</a> (my one year being a paid member is coming up). However, with that said I now see my <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/on-this-day/">On this Day</a> page doesn’t work 😒 (add that to my list to look into another time).</p>
<p>Thinking back, I can’t believe it took me so long to find this platform or maybe I saw it and didn’t think to use it.</p>
<p>Either way I have enjoyed the past year learning about what is possible and in some places figuring out a work around or how it can work for me. Honestly, the best part of Micro.blog is the community and acquaintances that I have made through this platform. It kind of fits with what I have always looked for when blogging. I do it mostly for myself but if someone else reads it and finds it interesting then great. Also, since it is ingrained into everything else on Micro.Blog then I can find others that are like minded and interested in similar topics.</p>
<p>Even after a year of using Micro.blog I am still not entirely sure what my setup is going to look like but for now it is working and the linking I have done between my older <a href="https://upnorth.blog">WordPress</a> blog works.</p>

			 <p>Well after all the build up for the past 9 months the race is done and I am happy with my own results. After, what has been a 20 year hiatus <em>(more on that below)</em> I was glad to conquer this one in much more style, less pain, and a time I had not planned for 😁. As I have told most people who ask me, it is amazing what some real training does when preparing for a marathon.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/3380c7fa50.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Building up to race day I was asked what time or pace I was shooting for and in reality I didn’t have much thought. Well there was some thoughts but honestly my goal was faster than 20 years ago time but more specifically I was shooting for under 4 hrs since I felt even being 20 years older I could bet that time of <a href="https://www.mtecresults.com/runner/show?rid=3083&amp;race=3588">4:12:11</a> by 12 min <em>(chip time)</em>. Not only did I beat that time I crushed it by 34 minutes for a time of <strong><a href="https://www.mtecresults.com/runner/show?rid=2402&amp;race=12105">3:39:28</a></strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/924e8a2dbb.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Also, I can’t thank my family enough for coming out to support me as it was great seeing people I knew from time to time throughout the day.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/b80a8a665b.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Not to mention my champion wife who was trucking around the Twin Cities to various points even though she didn’t know the roads very well while with her was 3 kids of which some expired at my 2 hr mark.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/e95deeb0dc.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>She was there for the first one 20 years ago so it was great to have her and the rest of my cheering section. Also, for the last push of 6 miles I saw my uncle on the sidelines saying “looks like you got this one” which was a great confidence booster in the middle of the 3 mile uphill climb.</p>

##2001 Race Background##
20 years ago on a whim I signed up for the 2001 Twin Cities Marathon sometime after I had just turned 20. I am not really sure what I was thinking but I believe in a way it was because I had not keep up running much from my High School days and missed it. I also thought I would share in the punishment and poor college student me signed my brother up (who was working at the time) as well since he lived in Minneapolis. I figured what was he going to do if I signed him up for it, not show up?</p>
<p>I jumped right into some training plan I am sure I found on the internet at the time and was following it religiously throughout that summer as I stayed up at school and all my friends went home. However, when the training plan started to tick up miles school was back in session and my training fell off the radar. I don’t even think I ran anything of value or consistency the month before the race. Talk about coming in cold. In fact, the longest I had run before that 2001 Marathon was 13 miles.</p>
<p>Let’s just say the day turned out as you would have expected, the adrenaline and excitement pushed me though probably 17 miles worth. Then I gritted it out for another 3 that I can’t remember. The last 6.2 miles were torchure and I think most of it has escaped me. From what I remember it was a lot of walking for that last 6.2 miles and seems right as up to that point I was tracking time well and then it took me one and fifteen minutes to complete that last 6.2 miles. I remember finally realizing that I as only 1 mile from the finish and I think that is when I started to somewhat run again knowing the end was finally in sight. The best part of that race was that I crossed the finish line with my uncle and to this day we all still joke how I touched the finish line first.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/2a678fda02.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>However, in reality when I was dying on those last miles at some point he passed me up and I caught back up to him in the final stretch. Since that time but probably not right after I kept telling myself that if I was ever going to run another one and I did want to I wanted to make sure I trained for it much better than before. Don’t get me wrong it wasn’t that the time was overly horrible but I knew I could have done better so it was my goal.</p>

			 <p>Earlier this week where I live a runner, <a href="https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-news/eden-prairie-man-found-dead-was-training-for-the-chicago-marathon">Mike Elhard</a>, who was going out on a 20 mile training run for the Chicago Marathon went missing on Monday morning. He wasn’t running at night or even during really hot weather as it was 10am and the day was actually cooler than normal. Once they realized he was missing the local police and residences searched that late afternoon and into the evening on roads and paths near his house and routes he frequently took. Unfortunately, he was found dead Tuesday just off a sidewalk in some brush. The police said there was no signs of foul play but nothing else has been released.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/c33ec0c365.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>As I was running yesterday, I couldn’t shake the thought out of my mind as I too am a runner mostly running by myself during the week. I am fortunate enough that my longer runs I have been running with a friend in the area.</p>
<p>Even though I never knew Mike, I want to think we might have crossed paths at some point along the trails and probably gave a nod, or wave or maybe just smiled at each other.</p>
<p>Mike was only 39 and probably in pretty good shape seeing how he was going to run a Marathon in a couple weeks as well and was out on his 20 mile long run. I am only 40 and it really puts things in perspective how short life can be sometimes. Rest In Peace fellow runner.</p>

			 <p>Honestly, I am not very good at keeping in touch with people. This could really be anyone, friends, old co-workers, newer acquaintances. For some reason, I always have great intentions of reaching out but just never feel it is the right time to reach out and say I will later.</p>
<p>I was reminded of this the other day while running and I passed an old co-worker and friend of mine walking with his wife. I said hi quick but since I was running with another guy I didn&rsquo;t stop to talk. After I got done I was reminded that I have been meaning to reach out to this guy for a long time and every time I would think about it I would find about 100x other things to accomplish. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong it has nothing to do with the other guy because I do this all of the time. It is just one of those tasks that always get buried for me thinking I will find a better time to reach out or I will do it right after work.</p>
<p>I guess you could say it is a good thing I am aware of it 🤷‍♂️. However, I am going to try to be better and see about setting time aside for starters each week to reconnect with some people whom I haven&rsquo;t but have been meaning to for a while. We all get busy from time to time and with kids thrown into the mix it gets even worse. However, there is always time to keep connections flowing instead of dead ends.</p>

			 <p>I had been an Android user for as long as I can remember and have always enjoyed the phones and software. Maybe I should caveat that last statement with I have had a bunch of iPhones too but at one point I was drawn more to Android and then I really had not looked back and honestly kind of refused to for no real reason. However, after being nagged by my family I broke down in May of this year to get the iPhone mini.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/48b69212e0.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>My original goal was to use the iPhone mini as my main phone for texts (iMessages specifically) but continue to keep my Galaxy S-21 as it took amazing photos and videos. I figured I would run with the Galaxy and use it when we went on family trips. However, I quickly remembered I did not like the two phone life after 2 weeks and ended up selling the Galaxy S-21 as it was still pretty new and there was some value I could get out of selling it. I think one of the big things for me that made this switch easy was the size of the iPhone mini, even though my Galaxy was not large the iPhone mini was the perfect size as I didn’t need a huge screen that was not the purpose of the phone for me.</p>
<p>After a month of using the iPhone mini with my Galaxy Tab S7 (with a keyboard of course), I started to get the itch of having the devices sync together better so that got me looking at the iPads. The original reason I got the Galaxy Tab was to use it as a replacement for paper to take handwritten notes at work. I could link up to my companies Office 365 and use OneNote which wasn’t all that bad and I liked having the notes on my tablet and computer synced (my work only had and still has Windows computers). The other reason I got the Galaxy Tab was to be able to have a more personal device when traveling for work and pre-pandemic I traveled quite a bit so it was nice to have a device of my own to do things on that wasn’t my work computer. So fast forward to the end of July it kind of seemed like a no-brainer to get an iPad as it could do what my Android tablet could do and it would sync better with my phone. So I broke down and bought an iPad Pro 11” with Magic Keyboard for iPad and the Apple Pencil 2.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/4f97487afa.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Now if only I could use a Mac for work instead of this clunky Dell Windows machine I would be happier but it is ok. With the iPad Pro 11”, since I got the keyboard, I mostly just carry that around to use when I am not working on work stuff in the house. I will give Apple a lot of credit here on the keyboard as they really did it right with how the keyboard works as it can be propped up by itself without needing to be set on a desk.</p>
<p>I feel like now with my new devices I need to go back and listen to all the Podcasts that I have in the past 4 years that talk about iOS apps as I always listened to them but a lot of the time since there was not an Android version I just forgot about them.</p>
<p><em>Next up finding new apps 😁..</em></p>

			 <p>Sometimes you have to <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/02/09/back-to-running.html">start over</a> at ground zero. Well technically I am probably not at ground zero this time because I only had four days off in a row.</p>
<p>This week however I have been getting back into running or restart my running has been a struggle. I have found it much more difficult that I would have thought based on the amount of mileage I typically run and how often I had been running each week. However, I am still probably not 100% better from my Achilles heel pain (or this is what my PT friends tell me I have). In addition, the heat and humidity earlier this week has not helped in my attempts to ease back into running. I restarted this week doing shorter than normal runs but since my only time was late afternoon I was battling getting back at it during the hottest times of day.</p>
<p>I have <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/07/08/it-is-official.html"><strong>45 days</strong></a> left until the Twin Cities Marathon &hellip; Right now my goal is to not get injured more and get my comfort level back up when running longer miles.</p>

			 <p>Was trying to find quote I was pretty sure I put in a note app at one point and realized I have a lot of note taking type apps. I really would like to get it down to <strong>one</strong> but some are better for just text but I like snapping photos to save in notes too.</p>
<p>As much as I don’t want another one does anyone have any suggestions for short style notes / photo notes?</p>

			<h1><a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/07/08/i-hte-running.html">📚 I H💛TE RUNNING AND YOU CAN TOO by Brendan Leonard</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/07/08/i-hte-running.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-07-08 07:32:00 -0600">Jul 8, 2021</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>If you are looking for a great motivational book to keep you going in whatever you are trying to do look no further. If you are looking for a book about how to run then this might not be what you are looking for but you should pick this one up as well to give you some laughs along your running journey.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The great part about this book is that it is all about the Running journey and exploring why people run and the motivation behind it. By using Brendan&rsquo;s and others' relatable running stories it frames up challenges all of us face to just get motivated to do things in life. There are always obstacles in the way, better things to do, or thinking we are too busy to do something. As a &ldquo;runner&rdquo; myself, I can personally relate to the specific stories of running as no matter how much I love running, being outdoors, It is much better to have the run done and behind me as I too am someone that struggles most of the time to just get out the door.  Specific to running, everyone has their own story and reasons why they run and Brendan also explores that as part of the book.</p>
<p><a href="https://semi-rad.com/2021/03/people-who-get-to-decide-what-the-point-of-all-your-running-is/"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Now I am a fan of Brendan Leonard fan of his work from his site <a href="https://semi-rad.com">Semi-Rad</a>, and this book did not disappoint. That being said, I have seen some of these graphs before but the rest of the story and context is short, witty, and perfectly sized for most of us to get through in a timely manor.</p>
<p>One of my favorite parts of the book is when he is talking about what he calls the &ldquo;invisible work&rdquo; which in the context of the book is all of the miles and hours you put in before a race or event. In fact, for someone like myself who is planning on running a <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/07/08/it-is-official.html">Marathon</a> later this year, I have already run about 37 marathons with the number of miles I have put in so far.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Inspiration is for amateurs. The rest of us just show up and get to work. - Chuck Close</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall, I couldn&rsquo;t recommend this book more but honestly don&rsquo;t just take my word for it and pick up a <a href="https://semi-rad.com/books/">copy from the links on his website</a>. The best thing is it is a smaller-sized book so you can carry it with you on all of your adventures (well maybe not while running) so you can refer to the helpful motivational kick in the butt that is needed from time to time while doing anything. Honestly, I wish I had this book a couple of years back when I was content with just running a <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/09/30/k-a-day.html">5k a day</a> as some days were harder to get motivated than others. As I am now running longer miles with slightly less frequency, I feel like this book helps keep me motivated to get out there.</p>

			 <p>Pretty sure I was chased by the same bird that followed me a couple of weeks <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/06/18/i-was-followed.html">back</a>. This time however it was less in a fun way of circling me and more of an attacking / intimidating me. I am guessing the bird has a nest that is close to this boardwalk path since it seemed quite upset with me after I ran by a specific bush that is really close to the path. I remember seeing it flying by me and then instantly circled and flew after me chirping along the way. I looked back probably 3 different times and it was no more than 5 feet from me in the air acting like it would like to peck me in the head. After I finally got away and realized it wasn&rsquo;t following me I snapped this picture.</p>

			 <p>This little issue sucked away a good chunk of time for me yesterday when all of a sudden the lights where I work shut off. Problem was some power was still flowing through to the tracks and even to the light fixtures but when I put a bulb in the fixtures nothing and the. I realized power would drop on other open light fixtures. That is when what I was hoping was a quick fix turned into a longer project as I had to take the whole track lighting down to get to the main wiring. That is when I found this gem 🤦‍♂️</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Yep, older wiring in houses are an adventure indeed.</p>
<p>Luckily, I have tackled something like this before as I have replaced out fixtures and outlets so I had all the supplies I needed to hopefully not have it happen again. All fixed now and track lighting is working perfectly again. 💡👨‍🔧</p>

			 <p>I often take pictures while out running as a way to document random things I see or things of interest. However, today&rsquo;s picture was entirely random to the spot but felt it gave a good view of the trail and beautiful day we were having here in Minnesota. It doesn&rsquo;t take me long to take a quick picture and put my phone away but to my surprise as I kept <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/5173882019">running</a> there were some deer watching me. In fact, looking back at my photo now I can spot one but I didnt see it tell after I started up again.  Makes me wonder in other pictures I have taken if I would look closer I would find something interesting 😁.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><em><strong>Forty</strong></em>… Yep, you read that right I hit the big <strong>4-0</strong> this year which besides the number I don’t feel much different today.</p>
<p>Looking back over the past year all I can say it has been a strange one indeed. I have always wanted the chance to work from home and boy did I get it. In the past year, I have only gone to the office three times and taken one business trip (which was just a month ago to the middle of nowhere Indiana).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However, some good things came out of last year as the whole family spent a lot more time together than typically. We purchased a Camper in July of last year and after getting it we found a way to use that thing almost every weekend until we put it in storage for the winter. We had been thinking of buying a camper for a while so once we saw that we probably wouldn’t be traveling like our normal road trips that we had been thinking about it seemed like no better time than to pull the trigger on the RV. I won’t say every trip was magical with the family but overall everyone enjoyed it and enjoyed exploring the various State Parks in our area. It was a good way for us to get away from our house and all the electronics that are inside of it. However, April and I did work on some of our camping adventures. We figured since we were both working remotely and if we didn’t mind having to be creative to connect to the internet it would be great to squeeze a couple more days on the front and back end of weekend trips.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Working from home has been interesting (ok bad sometimes) but in other ways good. It is hard to really slice and dice my complete thoughts on this but I think simply put I enjoy being able to get my kids on and off the bus each day. I appreciate this school year as opposed to last where they were learning from home full time as I am not a great teacher myself and those days it was harder to focus on my work. However, being honest my wife took the brunt of the teaching and keeping the kids on task and I am forever grateful for her always keeping the family in order. The hardest thing for kids I think to understand when they would have days off and mom and dad are working from home is they are not sure why we won’t play with them NOW. As smart as all my kids are, they are still shocked when they have a no school day and I still have to work. I think the kids believe that we should all be on the same schedule.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One of the benefits I have really been reaping this year working from home is Running. I used to be a morning runner by default because I wanted to get it done before I went to work each day. I knew myself and if I didn’t do it then, then I might not do it at all. This past year things have changed, I not only didn’t want to wake anyone up in the morning but I also realized that I could avoid running in the dark often as I could duck out for an hour during the middle of the day.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Embracing was the theme of last year and I feel like that was accomplished with how our family got to spend more time together doing different things and how more recently I have doubled down in focusing on my running personally. I came in strong last year thinking about running a Marathon but then when the pandemic hit and everything got canceled it only took me a month later to start lagging in my motivation to keep running a bunch of miles. However, I did get a spark of new hope after we got the camper again as we were visiting all of these cool State Parks that had miles of trails. So I made sure that every park I tried to explore as much as I could by either hiking with the family or just going out for a run at some point during our stay.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes a change of scenery is a great motivation to get out there and explore (or run).</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Since the start of January, I have decided to take a different approach to my running by really trying to get more longer runs weekly. Previously, I would have probably only run one or two 6.2 mile runs a week and that was about all I could handle with other 3.1 mile runs sprinkled in. Right now I have a goal of running the Twin Cities Marathon later this year as it has been exactly 20 years since I have run a marathon (that one in fact). I have something else up my sleeve as well but still working on the execution to make sure it goes through. If so it will be fun for sure and make that Marathon extra hard with the little rest between the events. I have been pleased with my efforts so far but the road is still long ahead. If anything, I have continued to build on longer runs throughout the week, and as a benefit, I have been able to explore a lot of new places around my house by going outside what was a 3.1 mile radius.</p>
<p>As things are ever-changing in the world today with the virus and vaccine rollout, I am optimistic to see what this next year will be as I am rolling into another decade. As I still am thinking Embracing seems like another fitting theme, I will expand that as I would like to continue <strong>“Learning”</strong>. More on that topic but this is long enough and the kids are about ready to get off the bus ☺.</p>

			 <p>Last night I was looking for a place I ran in Germany when I was there on a work trip in 2015. I then realized when I stopped using my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fitbit in 2019<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I didn&rsquo;t import that far back to my Garmin as I wasn&rsquo;t using Strava then either.</p>
<p>As I logged back into Fitbit for the first time in a long time I was hit in the face again with how terrible their activity log and reporting is. Not to mention if you want your GPS data back and not a crummy CVS output of steps good luck!</p>
<p>Unforentually, my realization that I did not import my data from 2014-2016 into Strava or Garmin sent me down a rabbit hole of manual tasks by finding all my old runs in Fitbit to download. I am happy to say that task is done and I can thankfully (hopefully) never log into Fitbit again 😁.</p>

			 <p>It has been <!-- raw HTML omitted -->5 years since<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the Blogging Meetup was started as it came about from a group of us that wanted to keep the conversation going after a Blogging Bootcamp that was put on by WordPress.com. Honestly, in thinking back I can not believe it has been 5 years but also, I know in the past 1.5 years the site has kind of remained the same and there hasn&rsquo;t been the engagement as there was in the first couple of years.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Long story short it is time to say <strong>goodbye</strong>… As of <em><strong>March 1,</strong></em> 2021, it will just remain an archive of information with nothing new posted.</p>
<p>I should probably address some simple questions that you may or may not be asking at this point…<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h5 id="why"><strong>Why?</strong></h5>
<p>Mostly because I feel like it is time and I think in looking at the stats the Community believes it is time as well. I think most people who have joined over the years found that the WordPress Reader does a great job of keeping you up to date on current posts and makes it simple to quickly interact with one another. Not to mention there are Twitter and Facebook that allow people to easily ask questions and interact/follow others with similar interests.</p>
<p>That is not to say I don&rsquo;t think a Community like this couldn&rsquo;t work or isn&rsquo;t valuable. I just think this specific community has run its course and it is time to close down.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h5 id="will-this-be-temporary-with-a-comeback-at-a-later-date"><strong>Will this be temporary with a comeback at a later date?</strong></h5>
<p>No, this is not just temporary. The plan is permanent but I will never say never. If something would ever take the place with the same name it would have to take on a different form altogether in my opinion but at this point, I have no plans to have a comeback tour.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h5 id="wont-you-miss-this"><strong>Won&rsquo;t you miss this?</strong></h5>
<p>Of course, I will miss this, even though I haven&rsquo;t used it much in the last year I believe the site provided a lot of great value over the years. Also, it is something that was created, time was spent dreaming up ideas and executing various actions to make it what it was. It was a passion project and I honestly enjoyed every minute I worked on it even when I was looming over my head to get another task or post published.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h3 id="closing"><strong>Closing</strong></h3>
<p>I could go on and on but in closing, I will miss the community we had as this was such a fun project over the past 5 years, and even though I am the one saying Goodbye I will still miss it. Thanks to EVERYONE who helped pioneer and champion, or those who joined, contributed, and followed along in the past. I wish each and every one of you more success in your blogging careers!</p>

			 <p>Has anyone ever considered instead of a specific Blog site to just create a Newsletter and publish that? With the abundance of them these days I am just wondering if someone has gone down that route and then pointed your domain to the newsletter archive page.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/a22665c019.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The major drawback I see would is if you were using your blog in a more microblogging site. Then it would maybe be silly to share out small bite-sized shares like photos, random thoughts, or other articles you might find interesting. On the flip side, you could just include the interesting thoughts, photos, and articles throughout the week and share it out once.</p>
<p>For now, I don&rsquo;t think this is something I would do but I do find it an interesting concept and would be very interested in knowing if anyone else has done this or thought about it too.</p>
<p>My experience with just newsletters is that I have tried it a couple of times in the past but was never really sure what to put in a newsletter that I hadn&rsquo;t already shared via social media or posted on my blog. This is, even more, the case now that I have started to use Micro.blog more for a single spot of all information as you don&rsquo;t have to try to figure out where it was posted.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I have always liked the idea of an exercise bike. In fact, last December when my wife was talking about buying one over a treadmill I told her to go for it. I assumed since I run so much outside in all kinds of weather why would I choose to run inside and not really moving? I mean, I like to explore the outdoors in all seasons. Snow, Ice, Ran, wicked winds all of those don&rsquo;t deter me if I am planning on running or want to run. Even in smog-filled cities or cities, I don&rsquo;t even know where I am going I prefer to run outside than on the treadmill. So easy enough a bike for indoors makes sense then&hellip; Or does it&hellip;</p>
<p>Over the past year, I have used the exercise bike 4 times, yep only 4, and one of them was in the first couple of days trying it out and the most recent time was today 😁. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong it isn&rsquo;t like the bike is buried away somewhere in the house so it is out of sight out of mind. In fact quite the opposite, since I have been working from home since March, it is in the same room as me so I can&rsquo;t really say I forgot about it 😁.</p>
<p>After some reflection and conversation with friends, I realized I would have been better off with a treadmill. It wouldn&rsquo;t have taken the place of my running, well maybe once or twice but ultimately I could have been walking on it while on phone calls or watching TV. The times when I can&rsquo;t leave the house for a run but could move at a moderate clip to get some exercise in.</p>
<p>Now you might be thinking you could do the same with an exercise bike Eric! And yes, that is true but the difference is the key&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>You have to keep moving or you will fall on the treadmill vs exercise bike you can slow to a stop and not give the same movement or output.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That right there is my answer. On a treadmill, you have to just let your subconscious take over to keep your legs moving at the pace you set. If not well it might not end well&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/3cff2b39c7.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>On the bike, however, I have to monitor the pace and use brainpower to have my legs move at the speed I want because the bike will not keep moving and pushing me forward. That right there gives me too much room to fail.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t that I am not determined in my workouts or exercise routines. It is just I am smart about it, I know my body and sometimes I need to trick it or force its hand. A couple of weeks back I was thinking I should run further but wasn&rsquo;t sure I really wanted to. So what did I do? I ran more or less a loop that requires me to run the whole thing in order to get back. No short cuts or stopping early. The distance was going to be the distance so I might as well run it.</p>
<p>So for me, Treadmills &gt; Exercise Bikes when it comes to a mindless activity to get your body moving.</p>

			 <p>More than ever I am guessing people are (or maybe are not) noticing how they are spending their time or maybe not as various schedules have been disputed over the last 6 months. I know mine has as I have gone from working in an office every day to working at home daily now.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I ran across this interesting article by Brad Feld titled &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Are You Spending Your Weeks The Way You Want To<!-- raw HTML omitted -->? Reading it gave me pause to think myself how I have been spending my time not only in this short 6-month window but over the past 39 years of my life. If this sparks some interest some further reading is the original article that Feld references which is published on Wait but Why titled &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Life in Weeks<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Personally, all the question Feld asked is really the questions I have been searching for over the last couple of months and maybe years at that. I am going to definitely spend some more time thinking through this. In addition, the original article dives in a little bit more and provides more food for thought.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2020/05/28/veil-by-eliot.html">📚 Veil by Eliot Peper</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Veil<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Eliot Peper (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->@EliotPeper<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) was just released a week ago and I really can’t say enough good things about it. If you are looking for a great book then look no further as Eliot has produced another great page-turner after not long ago finishing his most recent sequels.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/11f75ef022.jpg" alt="">
<em>The book was released on May 20th, 2020, but I was lucky enough to get an advanced copy from my good friend Eliot himself. However, I enjoyed the book so much that once it was released I purchased another copy as well for my collection.</em></p>
<p>Unlike some of Eliot’s other books, I actually felt like this one started a little slower but that was a good thing. As with a lot of good books, it built you up getting to know the characters and backgrounds. Speaking of, the main character, Zia León seems like your normal humanitarian that leads various aid missions to help areas in need. However, what makes Zia unique is she comes with sass and attitude that fits her well in order to get the job done.</p>
<p>As the first part of the story goes I was trying at times to see how all the pieces were going to fit together. Honestly, it took me a little while to start putting the pieces together, and then all of a sudden a kidnapping happened and I could not put this book down. Not only does the story speed up but more is revealed along the way that made it even more of a page-turner. I soon found out that the adventure was just beginning for Zia.</p>
<p>Eliot does it again by looking into the near future and laying out what might happened due to various social/global issues that are relevant in today’s world. With his ability to research those relevant topics, expand on them to plausible future events and outcomes all while crafting other drama into the story always amazes me. Don’t get me wrong there is more to the story than just social events as friendships are tested, betrayal unfolds, and stubborn relationships rear their ugly heads. Everything centers around Zia and she must deal with them all along the way.</p>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>The one thing I appreciate about Eliot’s books is the way he sometimes weaves things from other books into the mix. I might have only caught one referring to an open-sourced software architecture 😃 but I am sure there were more. Additionally, he finds ways to weave current locations and eating establishments that again makes the futuristic feel of this book that much closer to home.</p>
<p>I have really been enjoying Eliot’s near future books as the concepts and issues are not unrealistic to see come to fruition. Not to mention he always seems to be writing about topics that are big and bold and not just ones that change over the course of a year.</p>
<p>This is again one of those books I really can&rsquo;t recommend enough. In a time where politics seems to be guiding best practices for how we deal with climate issues, this book takes you to the near future in the path we could be on.</p>
<p>To make sure you don&rsquo;t miss out on his next books be sure to follow him on twitter (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->@EliotPeper<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) and subscribe to his newsletter from his website (<a href="http://www.eliotpeper.com/">http://www.eliotpeper.com/</a>).</p>
<p><em>As I mentioned I have read some of Eliot&rsquo;s books before and wrote about them so if you are interested to check out some of his other books go for it as you won&rsquo;t be disappointed! Here are a couple: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->True Blue (A Short Story)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bandwidth<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Borderless<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Breach<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</em></p>

			 <p>It seems strange trying to look back at the last year when there is so much noise clouding the past couple of days/weeks/months.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I am sure this will be shorter than some of the previous years as I feel like I have a little bit of a mental block. In fact, I was thinking about what I was going to write on the morning of what I deemed 6.2 Birthday miles but I didn’t come up with much. That is not to say that nothing has happened over the past year. Last year I wanted to focus on Embracing things more and trying to cut out things that didn&rsquo;t bring myself or my family joy. Overall, I feel like we kept moving in the right direction. We all continued to focus on things that brought us joy and in some cases started to let go of others.

<em>One last hike in before the storm rolled in and we had to leave Sedona (Airport Loop Trail, May 2019, Sedona, Arizona)</em>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
One of the things as a family we did was a last-minute trip to Arizona last May. We were not planning it at the beginning of the year but as my wife and I started to talk about it it just seemed like a great time to go visit family and also be together as a family. The week turned out great as we spent half the time with our Arizona family and then the other half in Sedona exploring all the trails. In fact, what was only going to be a one night stay we extended it to two as everyone was having so much fun.<br>

<em>Running along the Skywalker trail in the early morning hours (May 2019, Skywalker Trail, Sedona, AZ)</em>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I had a couple overseas work trips this past year and on these travels, I tried my hardest to embrace the surroundings and explore more. While traveling to China I made a point to see the Great Wall and I am happy that I braved the adventure as I found myself alone on the wall as I got there so early in the morning (thanks jet lag). Not all of my work trips had such a spectacular sight to see, however, I made the most of almost wherever I went mostly because my early morning or late afternoon runs would lead me to some interesting overlook or park.

Speaking of running, over the past year I continued on with my running and eventually hit a goal that formulated in my mind as the year went on. In October I had hit a mark of running a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->5K a day for 365 days<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The timing of that seemed to be about perfect as I am looking back at the last 5 months since I don&rsquo;t think I could have kept it up. However, my running goals have been focused more on distance now and not the consistency of every day running. Some other benefits of my odd running achievement were that I embraced the unknown and talked about my running adventure on a podcast called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Off the Couch<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It was something new to me and when they reached out I figured why not.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
With everything that is going on in the world right now and the focus on physically distancing us and the bans on travel in place as well. I think continuing with the theme of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Embracing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> seems fitting. We are in a very interesting time where my wife and I are both working from home and we have all of the kids with us every day for what might be the end of this school year. In addition, with no after school activities or playdates with friends, this is a great time to be together as a family and do things you always feel you never have time for. My wife and I were just commenting the other day how many weekends or nights do we really have nothing going on. So we are going to embrace this time together as a family and hope we all don&rsquo;t want to kill each other in the end 😄.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>After getting back from a short run earlier this morning I am currently sitting in our kitchen drinking coffee and pondering what today was suppose to be. More specifically, I am sad thinking about what today was supposed to be.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/faa634e28e.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>Today was supposed to be the start of my son’s last couple of basketball games at their State tournament.</li>
<li>Today was supposed to be a continuation of my middle child’s hockey Jamboree where it would be the last time they play with these girls for the season.</li>
<li>Today was also supposed to be when my youngest was going to perform on Stage dancing the numbers she has been practicing for the past 9 months.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, all of those things have been canceled due to the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Don’t get me wrong for public safety and health of all it was probably the right decision as in the grand picture of life it is not worth it. I am sad that all of my kids are missing the closure of their seasons where they have worked all year for not realizing that this past week of practice was the end.</p>
<p>Now don’t get me wrong, my wife and I are going to try to make the weekend as fun as we can in light of everything else that has been canceled as well. However, in the back of all of our minds will be that we should have been doing something else.</p>
<p>I am sure this is something that will be shared in the future with our kid’s kids and our kids will eventually share with their kid’s kids as the weekend where everything was <em><strong>canceled</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Till next time and we will try to enjoy the free weekend&hellip;</p>

			 <p>I can never pass up an interesting book and TCK Publishing reached out to me a while back to take a read through a book they had called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Design Your Future: 3 Simple Steps to Stop Drifting and Start Living by Dominick Quartuccio<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/c9f6d4f064.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Besides the title of this book, I had not heard of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dominick Quartuccio<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or this concept of drifting that he does do a great job of laying out at the beginning of the book. You will quickly find out in short drifting is just following along the status quo or coasting through life accepting everything that is happening.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“People do not decide their futures, they decide their habits and their habits decide their futures.” - <em>F.M. Alexander</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As someone who has written about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->habits<!-- raw HTML omitted --> before and not long ago had a very addicting habit that added up to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a lot of miles being run<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I was very interested in seeing what the author had to say. Not too far into the book he hits you with some quick questions like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Are you feeling bored? Restless? Trapped?&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and if your answers are yes then the solution is that <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It&rsquo;s Time to Take Back Control of Your Life<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, that is what the book is really based on. The nice thing about this book, in my opinion, is that it is short and very consumable. However, not too short that he doesn&rsquo;t add some examples throughout each topic. However, It is really broken down into 4 parts which have simple enough concepts:</p>
<h3 id="awakening">Awakening</h3>
<p>Being aware as you cannot change what you are not aware of. Uncover the habits that are operating in your blind spots. Once your habits are brought out into light you can inspect them and disrupt them.</p>
<h3 id="disrupting">Disrupting</h3>
<p>Disrupting is the process of interrupting your perpetual patterns and breaking the stimulus and response cycle. When you do this, you get immediate and profound feedback on why you do what you do, and how these habits may be serving or oppressing you.</p>
<h3 id="designing">Designing</h3>
<p>The first two parts of the book are pretty straightforward as he talks about how to pretty much break down your current habits and thinking in order to get to the designing part. In the designing chapter he talks a lot about Ultimate authority and how to set compelling goals. This is where he talks about creating new habits that empower your future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ultimate authority means taking responsibility for the fact that your life is the sum total of every decision you’ve ever made from the day you were born up until this very moment. This means you get to take credit for the many successes you’ve had. It also means the shit parts of your life are on you too.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="sustaining">Sustaining</h3>
<p>The part of the book I think makes the most sense. Obviously, if you have completed the above topics then you have to figure out a way to keep moving forward.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Awakening, Disrupting and Designing (ADD) Cycle we have just walked through in this book is a process that should be repeated and not a one-time exercise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above statement by the author was a great strategic point to make towards the end of the book for a reminder about sustaining. There are a lot of things we do in life thinking if we just do it once all is good. However, in reality, we need to continue to work on things no matter if it is trying to rid ourselves of excess possessions, weight, or anything else. Each day is a new day that you really have to tackle the problem again. The advantage you have as you build up the consecutive days is that it becomes a habit and less you might have to think about in the future.</p>
<h2 id="overall-thoughts">Overall Thoughts</h2>
<p>Overall, I enjoyed the book and if anything it made me think about various things I do and maybe things I have been thinking about changing or doing in my life but haven’t taken that next step. I really did enjoy that the book was a quick read as I could see myself flipping through the pages again at some point in time as it gives off a measure of motivation too.</p>
<p>If you think the book would be interesting to you, it can be found on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Amazon<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or through the publisher’s website (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->TCK Publishing<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>

			 <p>These days most of the reading I do is listening to someone read me a book. I have written about this before but I came across a tweet by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->James Clear<!-- raw HTML omitted --> laying out that audio is the biggest trend in books.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The continued rise of smartphones.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Billions of people already own a smartphone and billions more will soon. That&rsquo;s a massive force that makes it easy for anyone to always have a book on them.

<li>The continued rise of AirPods, etc.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The proliferation of compact headphones means billions of people will be consuming audio content.
Even if you don&rsquo;t start as a reader, it&rsquo;s a small step to go from podcasts or videos to audiobooks. It is the same type of consumption.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->— James Clear (@JamesClear) January 24, 2020</p>

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/97123464c3.jpg" alt="">
Honestly, he nailed this in my opinion.</p>
<h3 id="ease-of-listening-using-smartphones-and-headphones">Ease of Listening using Smartphones and Headphones</h3>
<p>His first two points around the change in technology I can&rsquo;t disagree with at all. The increase/change in technology has allowed audiobooks to be much easier to listen too as the technology has provided a very low barrier of entry and use. You can take them with you on the go and not have to worry about finding a cassette or CD player. Yes, you read that right, I just said cassette player. I was in that era where we had walkmans and boomboxes. So not super compact if you wanted to go on a run or walk around the house listening to your book tape. In fact, the first vehicle I purchased out of college had both a cassette and a CD player. Now the van my wife and I just bought 2 years ago doesn&rsquo;t have either.</p>
<p>The other change in technology that is similar but not specifically called out is a change in <strong>media type</strong>. As I just discussed with audiotapes and audio CDs, that is more physical stuff you needed to carry around. I remember renting an audiobook tape from the library back in 2004 and it had 10 tapes I had to carry around. I used to make a lot of trips to Chicago from Minneapolis so this is when I first started getting into book tapes as it was a way to pass the 7 hr drive by myself. However, I would have to always make sure to flip the tape or put in the next CD. Now you don&rsquo;t even have to mess with physical media as you can just download it on your phone, or tablet and go. In addition, it is much easier to get audiobooks, you can still get them for free from the library but now instead of having to go to the library to pick up your cassettes or CDs, you can just download them from Overdrive or something else your library might be connected with. Also, if you can&rsquo;t get them from the library or don&rsquo;t want to be put on the waitlist, you can quickly buy them through Audible or other platforms and pretty much listen to it instantly.</p>

<h3 id="everyone-loves-convenience">Everyone loves Convenience</h3>
<p>The third point he makes is the one that is maybe more concerning but even more spot on. I say that it is concerning as I am one of those people. Every year I have this idea in my head I am going to physically read more books but every year I only get through enough to count on one hand. Most of the ones I read like that are advanced copies I get from a friend show writes some pretty amazing books. Honestly, it is the convenience that I continue to stick with audiobooks because I can listen to them while doing a number of other things. I still don&rsquo;t know if that is a great thing to always multitask while listening to books but I don&rsquo;t see myself changing that. Most of the time it is when I am running or driving to work. For both of those activities, audiobooks are the perfect multitasking initiative. Also, both of those activities for me have a defined starting and stopping point that doesn&rsquo;t allow it to flow into other activities.</p>
<p>Another article I was reading titled <!-- raw HTML omitted -->“The Rise and Rise of the Books you Don’t read”<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Clare Thorp touched on a lot of other interesting benefits around audiobooks but one part in there was a different look at the <strong>Convenience</strong> topic above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Often audio <strong>is not</strong> competing with time spent with books,” says Richard Lennon, publisher at Penguin Audio. “It’s people who are either fitting books and authors into their day in new ways, so people who might be existing readers but have found that during their commute or exercising or cooking dinner, there’s an opportunity to listen. Or it’s an alternative to TV for people who are conscious of their screen time.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Bingo!</strong> Richard validated that a lot of the times when I personally listen to books are times I would not have been sitting on the couch reading a physical book. As it would be hard to run down the streets in the morning with a physical book in my hands.</p>
<p>However, I do listen to audiobooks sometimes in the evening as I am doing small tasks around the house. The only issue with this is that it translates into not just sitting on the couch and relaxing or winding down. It then has me wandering all around the house doing various projects and tasks. Then what ultimately ends up happening is that I continue to listen to it much longer and stay up later than I was anticipating. These are the times that go against what Richard was talking about as it isn’t really a new way and I just cut out a good way to get back to physical books. In fact, these specifically are the times I should have reached for the physical book instead and the more times I don’t I find the more times I don’t even think about physical books.</p>
<h3 id="so-are-you-going-to-change-any-of-your-habits">So are you going to change any of your habits?</h3>
<p>Probably not. Honestly, I do know I am taking the easier way out by listening to books instead of physically reading them but it works for me. Maybe when I am older and have some more time on my hands to sit by a fire or on my couch in the afternoon I will read more physical (or even digital) books.</p>
<p>For now, they are a good companion while running and driving to work so I don&rsquo;t see that changing. The only thing I might try to change very slightly is to listen to less in the evening in a way to either try to read a physical book or do something else with my time.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>It&rsquo;s Your Ship: Management Techniques from the Best Damn Ship in the Navy by Captain D. Michael Abrashoff is a really good book if you are ever contemplating a management position or are currently in a management position. The story does a great job laying out examples of how Captain Abrashoff took a poor performing ship in the navy to become one of the sought after ships people wanted to be assigned to.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Its-Your-Ship-Management-Techniques-ebook/dp/B001HPW9R4/"><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/3afb243583.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Even though most of the concepts are not new in this book nor do I think the author claimed that the methods he used were entirely his own. I do think how he accomplished them is very interesting and sheds some light on how he thought about things differently during his command. In fact, many of his stories are how he tried doing something one way only to talk through and come up with a better way. It goes to show you that he too was learning through the process from day one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course, trying something new is never easy. For one thing, there aren’t any precedents to guide you. And that can be a very good thing.
<em>- Captain D. Michael Abrashoff</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, as much as I enjoyed the book I feel how it was laid out did not necessarily flow as well as I would have liked as I feel he repeated himself from time to time. The reason for that is obvious as he was breaking down chapters into Management topics and not in the chronological order that events happened. It is just something to think about as sometimes I was trying to figure out in what order he started to do certain things or implementing new tactics.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>Different than some of my other book reviews I am going to just write out a couple of notes I took that may or may not be helpful to you. Now as I mentioned the book is very focused from a managers prespective. However, the notes I took could be turned inward as well. Depending on your line of business or work you do because in all honesty aren’t we kind of an employee even if it is for ourselves?</p>
<p>As I read the book the following themes stuck out to me that could be used in any situation depending on how you read it.</p>
<h4 id="lead-by-example">Lead by Example</h4>
<p>This seems to go without saying. Can you actually do what you are asking others to do? Also, if you got different results than you were expecting to ask yourself his simple questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did I clearly articulate the goals?</li>
<li>Did I give people enough time and resources to accomplish the task?</li>
<li>Did I give them enough training?</li>
<li>Listen Aggressively</li>
</ul>
<p>Abrashoff got personal in his discussions with the crew while learning about their personal lives, why they joined the Navy and their thoughts on how to improve the ship. By taking the time to listen and not just give orders he discovered that he had a crew of smart, talented, and innovative men and women, but they weren’t being heard. This can be true in many interactions today, sometimes the best thing to do is listen to the other people instead of making sure your voice is heard. You might find something out that can be more beneficial to your purpose or goal.</p>
<h4 id="communicate-with-purpose">Communicate with Purpose</h4>
<p>No matter how fantastic your message is, if no one is receiving it, you aren’t communicating. It is up to you to clearly define the mission and vision of the organization and then to communicate clearly and concisely.</p>
<h4 id="take-risks">Take risks</h4>
<p>Everyone in an organization must feel comfortable taking calculated risks. The key is to know the parameters in which they can take those calculated risks and that everyone understands that you might not always win. Remember to not over encourage perfection as it will limit your ability to think creatively and take risks.</p>
<h4 id="praise">Praise</h4>
<p>As a manager myself I found this one spot on with his quote.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show me a manager that ignores the power of praise and I will show you a lousy manager, praise is infinitely more powerful than punishment.
D. Michael Abrashoff</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, as with most of these points above, the simple act of giving praise to someone even if you don’t have a working relationship as the book describes can go a long way. There are a lot of people putting stuff out there and the act of giving recognition might seem small for you but 100x the effect for the person receiving it.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I would recommend this book as I found it an interesting read with a couple of good takeaways.  I don&rsquo;t think this book is for everyone as some of the takeaways can be found in other books. However, I enjoyed hearing the stories of how Captain Abrashoff achieved his success.</p>

			 <p>Some days you just have to keep going. That is what I told myself as I hit mile 2 of my 3.1 mile loop I have run many times before.</p>
<p><em><strong>So what did I end up doing?</strong></em> Well, I just added on another 3.1 mile loop in a completely different direction in order to just keep moving along.</p>
<p>I had originally planned to do a longer run today so I set my alarm really early to ensure I would have enough time to get it done. When the alarm went off I was just too comfortable laying in bed that I stayed there for a really long time. Finally, after a lot of time ticked by I told myself I had wasted enough time laying around and I should get outside to run. However, I figured I only had time for 3.1 mile route instead of the one I was planning on doing.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/c9b6296589.jpg" alt="">
<em>Looking at the sunrise after a great long run (December 2019, Eden Prairie)</em></p>
<p>Being a little bummed about not doing what I had planned, I was glad that I got outside to do something instead of skipping it altogether, which was also on my mind. I didn’t feel great running at first either so I knew just sticking to an easier route was a good plan so then I could get home and have some time before I rushed off to work. However, as I looked at my watch and realized I was at about 2 miles into my run and approaching my house I thought why not just continue and run another 3.1 mile loop that goes a different direction.</p>
<p>So that is just what I did and I continued on a different route.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s not so much that I began to run, but that I continued”</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Hal Higdon</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>You might be wondering why I shared the story above with you but stick with me and read on</em> 😄</p>
<p>I was glad to have extended my total run to the full 6.2 miles I had planned to run the night before. Even though I took a completely different route than planning, I ultimately achieved the same goal I set out to accomplish.</p>
<h3 id="reflection-on-paths-and-moving-forward">Reflection on Paths and Moving Forward</h3>
<p>As I reflected on that driving to work today I realized a lot of people (me included) focus too much about what path we planned to be on in order to reach our end goal. However, by being so focused on the current path we could be losing sight of what we really want as an end goal. In fact, we could miss a turn that might take us off the current route but still headed in the right direction overall.</p>
<p>This has happened to me quite a few times most specifically in careers or jobs. I know what I would like to be doing down the road from now or how that might look. However, sometimes I get so stuck in a role (path) thinking it will eventually get me there as I had originally planned. Then another year goes by and I realize I am no closer to where I would like to end up and in reality, I might be further behind or off track. If only I would have stopped ignoring other interesting routes that would probably lead me to the same destination as my goal.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I am beginning to learn that taking small steps and keeping the course is a good thing in life as long as you continue to move forward. However, you should make sure you are aware of your surroundings and make sure you aren’t just following a path because that was your original plan. You also need to make sure you are keeping your head up and making sure you aren’t so focused on the trail in front of you that you might be passing up other opportunities.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/12/13/mini-sabbatical.html">Mini Sabbatical</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/12/13/mini-sabbatical.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-12-13 12:55:21 -0600">Dec 13, 2019</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A couple weeks ago I was on what I called a mini sabbatical but in reality, it was just a week off of work before I started a new job. During that week I fully appreciate and understand why rest is important. I think the overall concept of time away from work is something more companies should figure out how to offer. I know some companies have programs like actual sabbaticals after putting in a number of years at companies. I think the idea is great and I think it could be something done on a smaller scale too. I think the most important aspect is to figure out how to allow people to have some time away from where they can really disconnect.</p>
<p>Disconnecting is what you hear about all the time now and after a week of being fully disconnected, I know there are benefits there. I have always taken time away to spend time with family and I would say I was “disconnecting” from work. However, I was never truly disconnected. I was still getting work emails on my phone and more often than not I carried my work laptop with me to where I was going. So in theory as much as I was saying I was “disconnected” I was still connected by checking and making sure nothing went wrong back at work while I was away. Even if I wasn’t responding to anything, I was still glancing through things to make sure nothing big was going on and filling stuff away in order to make it easier for when I got back to work.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However, on this “break” I didn’t have email or work issues that came up or even could be brought my attention. When I left work on my final day, my email and connection to that job disappeared as well. I was unemployed as I was in between jobs and it was great. I was hoping that my wife and I could have escaped somewhere fun for a couple of days but seeing how this wasn’t planned very far in advance. So my wife still had to work and the kids still had school and their normal after-school activities.</p>
<p>However, that was honestly perfect for me as it allowed me to do more with the kids before and after school as I was still there. However, it also gave me a chance to just do random things during the day from 9am - 4pm when my kids were at school. I took the dog to the dog park where she was just in heaven as there wasn&rsquo;t anyone there and she could just run around as fast as possible.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I spent the week doing things I enjoyed but honestly, I could have had another week to get even more stuff done as I had planned on taking the time to read a book (yep never happened). I did make sure to sneak in a couple of long runs, multiple runs per day, as well as a fun park that was a lot of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hill running<!-- raw HTML omitted --> but worth the views.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In fact, I even met up with my cousin for a run one of the days I was off. It was good to get outside as well as catch up with her.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Finally, I took my wife out on a couple of lunch dates where we could take our time eating and just enjoy each other&rsquo;s company with nothing big to rush to the next event or worry we are paying some babysitter to allow our kids to watch TV at home :).</p>
<p>I am sad that my time away from work is over as I am now three weeks into my new job. However, I am going to think of ways going forward that I can take a week off and just be at home as disconnected as I can. Another thought is to just take some random days off here and there where I can just do my own thing without other priorities or reasons for taking the day off. I believe that would allow me to be refocused and refreshed going back to work the next day.</p>

			 <p>Have any of you been a part of an Online Community? If so I would be curious about what it is, how it works, does it cost you anything and if you feel you have gained any value from it? Feel free to leave a comment below.</p>
<p>I have been a part of a couple over the years and today I want to talk about the Break the Twitch Member Community. I have been a member since the beginning and I will say it has definitely been worth the value I paid and continue to pay. Not only do I get to help keep the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Break the Twitch website<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Podcast<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ad-free but also get access to an amazing community of supporting individuals and other resources. In the community specifically, you will find both Anthony and his wife Amy who are active by either leading and/or contributing to discussions.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now time to interrupt my normal style of writing with some questions and answering in order to fill in the blanks of why this post exists.</p>
<h4 id="ithis-is-great-why-are-you-telling-me-this-is-it-a-sales-pitch-are-you-going-to-get-a-commission-on-thisi"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is great why are you telling me this, is it a sales pitch? Are you going to get a commission on this?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h4>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->NO<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->NO<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This is not a sales pitch and I don’t get anything if you would happen to sign up. Well, I guess technically I get to have you in the community if you sign up so that is something. The real reason I am talking about the Break the Twitch Member Community is to get the word out there. I have been a part of the community for almost 2 years and figured it was time to give a little extra back as I realized that I have never talked about it or said I had joined.</p>
<h4 id="iso-why-did-you-joini"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So why did you join?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h4>
<p>It seems like a fair place to start out. I have been part of communities before and the best communities are made better by the people in them. Each member (the creators are included in this one) is supporting each other along their own journey. Some of our journeys are the same but others are wildly different. That doesn’t matter though because the other members can help become your support system for you to do the tasks or things that matter most.</p>
<p>When I originally joined there were not many of us as it just launched. I didn’t hesitate as I have followed Break the Twitch for years and felt like this way one way for me to give back to a creator trying to create something to help people. Also, I believed in what Anthony was saying from the beginning. A little fun fact, I looked back in all of the posts I have had on this site and I have talked about Break the Twitch more times than I remembered (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->One Decision<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Power of the Habit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fall Clean up and Clean out<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<h4 id="ii-have-been-part-of-communities-before-and-they-sometimes-fizzle-or-conversations-die-out-how-is-the-btt-community-and-why-would-it-be-betteri"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have been part of Communities before and they sometimes fizzle or conversations die out. How is the BTT Community and why would it be better?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h4>
<p>I too have been part of other communities before and in fact, started one that I feel is in that dying out phase of life (more on that other time). By my own experiences in communities, I have found that the best communities need champions and that is where you have Anthony and Amy actively engaging with people in the community. Not to mention all of the other members have some motivation to be active as well because there was a reason we all joined, to begin with. Additionally, since everyone is paying something to be a part of it that brings an increased level of commitment on everyone&rsquo;s part.</p>
<h4 id="isounds-great-but-i-dont-really-want-to-be-active-in-a-community-right-now-or-what-if-i-get-busy-and-cant-be-active-in-the-community-wouldnt-that-mean-i-will-not-really-be-getting-my-valuei"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sounds great but I don’t really want to be active in a community right now or what if I get busy and can’t be active in the community. Wouldn’t that mean I will not really be getting my value?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h4>
<p>Another great question and to be honest I am that person a lot of the time. I will not lie I am not the best community contributor. I come in and out of discussions all of the time. It is not that I don’t find value in the discussion or monthly challenges they have. Trust me they are all great things, but for me, it comes down to my other priorities and which one fits for me at the given month/time. There is always value to be gained as the Break the Twitch Membership allows you access to a library of Audio courses that you have access to all the time. For someone that travels and spending a lot of time running around the streets, these courses are great to load on my phone and hit the road.</p>
<h4 id="ididnt-you-meet-anthony-is-that-skewing-your-thoughts-herei"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Didn’t you meet Anthony? Is that skewing your thoughts here?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h4>
<p>Yes, and no. I did meet Anthony for the first time a couple of years back before the Membership community was open. As I said before I had been following Break the Twitch for some time and since we lived in the same area it made it easy to meet up. Meeting him in person confirmed what I had originally thought that he seemed like a super easy to talk to, down to earth, and overall really nice guy. I would have joined the membership community even if I had never met him. However, I will say the way he presents himself on the podcast, and in the Member Community group is how he is in real life.</p>
<p>Speaking of meeting with him, now granted you might not be able to meet him in person as I did, but after signing up you can take him up on the offer of a 20 min coaching call. Not to mention you can interact with him in the Community chat group.</p>
<h3 id="ifinal-thoughtsi"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Final Thoughts<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h3>
<p>Hope you enjoyed this different style of post today. It came about based on a discussion with someone about the community. In addition, I had just completed the longest run I have done in years and some of it is thanks to the Podcast going in my ears that kept pushing me along.</p>
<p>If you have any questions for me about the Community let me know in the comments below as I am more than happy to answer them. Otherwise, I would suggest you check out the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Break the Twitch Community<!-- raw HTML omitted --> page as it has some FAQs at the bottom. Lastly, feel free to reach out to Anthony as you can find him on social media or his email at the bottom of the linked page above.</p>

			 <p>This is an old video produced by the New York Times but I only stumbled upon it a while back and thought it was not only cleverly put together but also the real story behind it is just as interesting.</p>
<p>The video is about 6 min long and if you haven&rsquo;t seen it I feel it is worth the listen as there is some great acting involved in what was a real disposition.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PZbqAMEwtOE" alt=""></p>
<p>Now many people might just think that the video above is really funny because obviously we all now know what a photocopier or copy machine is. However, I remember back to my first couple of jobs in High School there was a lot of people there that called any type of copier a &lsquo;Xerox&rsquo;. The term became a verb instead of just a brand because it was so generalized (e.g., Can you xerox this for me?). Fast forward to today Google has done the same thing in search. Most of the time you don&rsquo;t hear people say will you search the internet for it. You hear them say &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you Google it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em><strong>What are some other brands that you know of that are used as generic terms or verbs?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Here is some more background on the actual case from the video above if you are curious.</em></p>

			 <p>I have used my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fitbit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> since January 2014 after what I remember was a long time trying to decide if I really wanted one and if so which one. Thinking back it has served its purpose well and I will give it some credit for keeping me active over the past years.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Over the course of the timeline above, I used a handful of watches. Most I bought because I wanted GPS capabilities however I did own two that were only step counters. From the data above you are probably wondering why there is a big gap in 2014. Long story short after I decided on getting a Fitbit at the end of 2013, I went for the new Fitbit force since it could actually show the time as I thought it was silly to just have a tracker band on my wrist. Unfortunately for me, I had issues with that watch and had to return it. At that time they didn’t have a replacement as all of them were recalled so they just returned my money in Full.</p>
<h2 id="positives">Positives</h2>
<h3 id="community">Community</h3>
<p>Due to the fact Fitbit was kind of a pioneer in the step tracking market, a lot of people jumped on board quickly. I don’t recall when they started their community to connect with people and have challenges but it has been for as long as I can remember. This is something they did well early on too as it encouraged people to do more in order to try to keep up with family or friends. I enjoyed looking at where people&rsquo;s 7-day averages were and how well I did against them.</p>
<h3 id="customer-support">Customer Support</h3>
<p>Hands down the one thing Fitbit has done (at least from my perspective) from day one is having great customer support. Put aside the question of quality as remember early on this was a new type of technology. I have purchased 5 different <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fitbit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> devices for myself during the 5 year period.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fitbit Force (Step tracker with Time Display) - Recalled</li>
<li>Fitbit Flex (Step Tracker ONLY) - Free replacement after it got water in it</li>
<li>Fitbit Surge (GPS Watch) - Free replacement after the band broke as this version doesn&rsquo;t have removable watch bands</li>
<li>Fitbit Ionic (GPS Watch) - Free replacement after it just died and didn&rsquo;t turn back on</li>
<li>Fitbit Aria (Scale) - Still the original / never got a replacement</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I have had 8 devices. The first one was a factory recall and I got my full purchase price back. For the other 3, I purchased I had issues after a year or more and they replaced the device free of charge. When you spend more than $150 on newer technology and you are frugal it is a relief knowing that they stand behind the product.</p>
<h2 id="main-issues">Main Issues</h2>
<h3 id="reporting-data">Reporting Data</h3>
<p>This was never really an issue years ago but as my use of my Fitbit watch changed it became more apparent. After having my year of running <!-- raw HTML omitted -->5K a day<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and wanting to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->look through the data<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and look back at things, I quickly realized that looking back at specific data in your Fitbit is near impossible. How can I find all of the “Runs” I completed in the previous year.</p>
<p>You can click on the activities tab but everything is an activity and there is no good way to sort by type of activity. In addition, I can’t even easily export the information to do anything else with it. The good thing is most of my runs are in Strava which makes it super simple to export and look back at specific types of Activities (e.g., Runs vs Bike Rides).</p>
<h3 id="unreliable-gps--watch">Unreliable GPS / Watch</h3>
<p>This kind of goes with my gripe above with data, however, a GPS watch itself is only as good as when it is tracking. If I didn’t want to know where and how far I ran, then I would not have paid over $250 for my Fitbit Ionic and just bought a $30 Timex like I used to wear in High School.</p>

<p>However, since I did spend that money on a GPS watch that is what I want. Below are some great examples of when my Fitbit would just fail me in the middle of the run. I realized that the map makes it look like I stopped and just didn’t complete the loop back to my house. Just for reference though, I do not stop a half-mile from my house as I always make it all the way back to my starting point no matter how much further that makes me run.</p>

<h2 id="will-i-miss-anything">Will I miss anything?</h2>
<p>I will miss the Community and the data I already have out there. I have tried to pull over as much data as I can into my new system but not all data is created equal even when importing. As I noted before since all of my runs were in Strava that was easier to get and import all of those into a new system.</p>
<p>As for the community, I will miss that as well since two of my kids have Fitbits and it was always fun being able to quickly see how I ranked over them. Even with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3.1 mile runs every day<!-- raw HTML omitted --> my kids still beat me in steps, unless they didn’t wear their watch. However, as for other family and friends, they too have started to drift away from Fitbit.</p>
<p>My guess is most people got Apple watches and didn’t want to wear both. Or if they wanted more of a Runners / Workout watch they went to Garmin or Suunto. I have been connecting with runners on Strava and it seems most drift to Garmin.</p>
<h2 id="question-for-you">Question for you?</h2>
<p>Do you track your steps or fitness activities using a watch? If so what kind do you have? If you have had a Fitbit ever what kind did you have and what are your thoughts on it?</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Fall is one of my favorite times of the year. Mostly because the weather is cooler outside and I have been known to pretend I am allergic to heat and humidity. As a runner, the cooler weather is welcome but you have to live with the downside of running in the dark morning or night hours. However, fall is another time when you need to start thinking about cleaning up the yard of leaves or putting away the summer stuff, and finding all the winter gear.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Since we have younger kids we put up a pool in the summer and an ice rink in the winter. Both of those things require some infrastructure that needs to be stored in the off-seasons. I don’t mind having to put it away but when this happens it always becomes a day project as it gives me some time to really clean up the other clutter that has been accumulating during the other 3-6 months.</p>
<p>I have written before about how we have used <!-- raw HTML omitted -->House Projects to Help Declutter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as well as using the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Seasons<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to help clean up areas of our house as well. However, most of all of that energy in decluttering started after I read the book “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The More of Less<!-- raw HTML omitted -->” by Joshua Becker. Not only did the book energize me to start some of those decluttering projects around my house but also the book gave me access to a course that connected me with a community of people who wanted to and were going through the same process.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Uncluttered<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was the course and it was great because it was only a 12-week course focusing on various aspects of becoming uncluttered. However, in reality, the underlying message was not to just trash everything and live in a house with nothing. No… because who would really want to do that. The course walked you through how to figure out what is important to you and helps challenge your thinking of what is important so in the end, you hopefully will know exactly what is important and lift the weight by removing the other “stuff” cluttering your life.</p>
<p>The best part about the course is that you get lifetime access. So for someone like me, I enjoy that because I have done the course a couple of different times. Not only as a refresher but also as a way to get motivated again. As I said at the beginning of this article, I have two big clean-up events every year due to the infrastructure of outside stuff I need to put away. I am approaching one right now and even though I would love to say I decluttered our house once and after that, all was well… Well, that is not the case, it is something you have to intentionally work at going forward because let&rsquo;s face it everyone is busy and stuff can start to pile up again. So for me retaking this course that continues to inspire me is time and initial money well spent.</p>
<p><em>Ok, I need to make something clear because I do not want you to think I am trying to pull one over on you. I know the previous paragraph seemed a little sales pitchy. Note that is not my intention,  I am only telling you things from my own experience and no one is paying me to write this article. I would not try to convince you that something is good if I have never used it before and given it a try.</em></p>

			 <p>You asked for it so let&rsquo;s dive into the data! I knew this was going to be a follow-up post to the one I just <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/09/30/k-a-day.html">wrote earlier this week</a> about my 5K a day. Maybe it is because I am kind of a data nerd and you were shocked I didn’t publish any data or charts with my last article. Or maybe it is because you wanted to see when and how far, fast or what time of day I completed my runs. It could have been that you were not 100% sure you believed me in my last article and were waiting to see some proof.</p>

<em>The glow of the sunrise in the clouds and off the water is something that never gets old for me (April 2019, Eden Prairie, MN)</em></p>
<p>I didn’t put it in the other <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/09/k-a-day.html">article</a> because I had some real hesitations about posting it. Not because I am trying to hide anything, in fact, you can follow <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/ericmwalk">my Strava account</a> if you are a runner and like doing that type of thing. The reason was that the data is not perfect and it took me some time putting it all together. I am not going to bore you with all of those details in this post as I might have to save those issues for another. However, all of the data in the charts came from <a href="https://www.strava.com/">Strava</a> and <a href="https://www.fitbit.com/">Fitbit</a>.</p>
<p>So without further ado, here are some fun charts to look at from the past year where I completed 1189.45 miles with a little color commentary.</p>
<h2 id="when-did-you-run">When did you run?</h2>
<p>This is one of the first questions I got after my previous post, When did I do most of my running? I have been asked this question by friends and family members before and without looking at the chart my answer was always the morning without a doubt. With 3 kids in activities, the morning was the one time I could really control what I did. If I didn’t do it first thing there was always a chance that plans could change and I would be doing it at midnight. However, it did get me thinking about how often I ran the rest of the day over the past 12 months.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/35173af475.jpg" alt="">
As you can see morning took it by a landslide. Now that it is Fall again and almost time for Winter I was reminded that running in the dark is not my favorite as I have been spoiled for the last 3-4 months of the morning running with the sunrise. This morning I just cranked out 6 miles and it was all in darkness.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/f79835fb4b.jpg" alt="">
<em>Always a win when I would find a new route that actually has some street lights (Septemeber 2018, Eden Prairie, MN)</em></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/3c38defd81.jpg" alt="">
<em>Completed my annual self made &ldquo;Turkey Trot&rdquo; in the early morning hours while watching the sunrise (November 2018, Nevada, IA)</em></p>
<p>Now being the data nerd I am I was thinking the next best slice would be to see a number of runs/miles by the day of the week. I was interested to see that I ran fewer miles on the weekend than I did during the week.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/87a9e1be53.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Now here is where I am going to kind of skate over data quality because it might be more valuable in another post as I will probably rant quite a bit on that topic. However, I have some double runs during the middle of some weeks due to international flights. In addition, not to play down my commitment to running because there were a couple of times in the past year I ran twice a day by CHOICE! You read that right I chose to run not only in the morning but at night as well. Don’t worry I didn’t make a habit out of it and it only happened because as I said previously I sometimes had to plan a week out in advance. Obviously, since I mostly wanted to get my runs done early as a way to not forget, someone would message me mid-day seeing if I wanted to run that evening. I mean how could I say no?</p>
<h2 id="friday-mornings-take-the-real-win">Friday Mornings take the real WIN!</h2>
<p>After looking at that last set of data I pondered if there was anything else I would like to see. That is when it hit me that it would be interesting to see based on the day of the week when did I typically run.</p>
<p>I was not really sure what to expect on this chart before pulling it together. The only thing I could think of was besides mornings probably being pretty spread out during a given week. I would have thought more evening runs as I would try to squeeze them in right after work or while at a kid&rsquo;s activity. As you can see from the data below, that is not entirely what is being shown.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/fdefdfdb5f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>After looking over the chart below I came to two realizations:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am not sure how Strava categorizes Morning, Lunch, Afternoon, Evening or Night run. The biggest problem I see here is that there is a big gap between what I would consider Morning and Lunch. Then in the afternoon and evening, I am not sure what that fine line is to trip it from Lunch to Afternoon to evening. I spot checked a couple of specific days and it was counting afternoon as 5:50 PM. Not sure if that is where it should fall but then the data started to make more sense as in the winter months for sure I ran more in the early evening (or still Afternoon) while my son played basketball.</li>
<li>I made a concerted effort to never run at night on Friday and in fact, it was the heaviest day of morning runs. I had never really thought of it but accept what the data says. Most of my Friday nights kids don’t have activities so with that in mind we are either doing something as a family at home or traveling somewhere for the weekend. Not to mention if you want to have a drink with the neighbor while grilling after work on a Friday it is best to get you run in early.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also did a similar slice based on miles but as you can see it didn’t really tell me anything as the chart looks about the same since I was always hovering around 3.1 miles with very rare exceptions though most of and then at the end.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/ef806307e5.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="pace">Pace</h2>
<p>Finally, after I was pulling all this data together I was wondering what was my average pace over the course of these 12 months. The overall answer is 7:47 min miles. I decided to create some quick average charts by day and month. The day chart kind of puzzled me except when thinking about the other data above. I most likely got better rest before my Saturday run as I didn’t always have to do it at dawn.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/3800be7ba7.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>When you look at the monthly chart this is even more interesting but I have a few ideas of why it might look like it does.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/69003594bd.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>From when I started till about January I was on a steady decline. However, those runs were mostly solo in nature and a more consistent route due to darkness, and early snowfall. Don’t forget it got cold in January and I might have tried to run faster outside just to get the run done in the early morning.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/a50e43f3bf.jpg" alt="">
<em>Running with my daughter and the dog. Not a bad way to start the day as it is always filled with conversations. Not to mention more stops by both to see and listen to nature (March 2019, Eden Prairie, MN)</em></p>

<em>Frozen face run in -9.4°F (February 2019, Eden Prairie MN)</em></p>
<p>The Spring months I was running more with Lainey Lou the Doodle (our dog) which then slowed down my pace. In addition, I would run sometimes with my daughter who would like to bike along with me and sometimes she just wanted to stop. Finally, in the late April / May timeframe it was starting to get nicer out that I could do more trails around the area. In May especially, I was traveling and was running in the hills of Arizona, streets of China and a number of Treadmill runs due to the arrival of flights. I know that Treadmill run data was about the worst because I only have my watch data to go on and most of the time it never said I ran as far as the treadmill said I did.</p>
<p>So after all of my analysis above, I got to thinking I might be missing some data here that might be in addition to the chart above. The one above only gave average pace but I was more curious about what the min and max were as well. I think this chart helps answer some of those questions.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/7ee112f17d.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Looking at the chart above I think it further supports my hypothesis of running in different places and on the treadmill.</p>

<p>I figured since I was sharing all of this data anyways I should probably share some Personal Bests during my year of running. I was thinking of doing a chart like some of the above but I realized I didn&rsquo;t really have good data around this. Mostly because I didn&rsquo;t always stop running right at 3.1 miles, so it would be hard with the data I have to give more meaning than overall bests.</p>
<p>Luckily, Strava has some overall personal bests that I could easily get and all of them except for the 10k came from a race I did in the summer. In looking at the data now, I wish I would have broken the 20 min mark but I can&rsquo;t really complain as I was never shooting for a specific time. Also, I did well as I was in the top 15 overall and  2nd in my age group.</p>
<p>I actually did 2 races over the past year and surprised myself during both of them with good enough times considering I was running every day with no breaks. Running a 5k a day made me realize that running those 5K races were really nothing. I did them every day so it wasn&rsquo;t a big deal, I knew I would finish it so then it was just a matter of at what point in the race should I pick up my pace or pass someone.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I never really set out to put any data together when I originally started running. In fact, I didn’t really think about it when I realized that I was actually going to be running for a year. To both of those facts, I might have been a little short-sided, as looking back I would have done things differently in order to make sure I had the data easily available. I would not have used it to change what happened on a day to day basis as my goal was never to run faster or even longer. I did use my Strava data and my Fitbit data to just look back at a given week or compare runs every now and then to see if there was any small progress. However, my ultimate goal was the consistency of doing it every day.</p>

			 <p>I ran a 5K a day for 365 Days in a row and counting… Most people will think that is crazy and pointless. I have run well over 1131.5 miles over the course of the past year (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->check out the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->data analysis<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> of all my runs or give a listen to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Off the Couch podcast<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I was on talking about it<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I have always been a runner, or so I say I have always been a runner. There was a time I distanced myself from running in my later college years up until about 4 years ago. I actually wrote about it a couple of times ok maybe more than a couple but I wrote about it when I got <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Back into Running<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and when I was using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Running to Refocus<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.

<p><em>There is something great about running as it is just PURE. You can only move as fast as YOU can, as far as YOU want, and as long as YOU can. However, it is all up to YOU to determine what YOU “can” do and what you get out of it.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="planning-is-key">Planning is Key</h2>
<p>Honestly, this is the biggest takeaway I learned over the past year was planning. If you want to make something a priority you need to plan time for it in order for it to be a priority. For me in order to make running a priority in my life, I had to make sure to keep it a priority, and sometimes I had to get creative. I would look at my schedule on a day to day or even a week out and figure out when I planned to run. This sounds a little crazy that on a Sunday night I was already planning on when I was going to run the following Saturday but honestly I had to do it. Not just for when it would make sense to me, like running in the morning, but for my family and other work priorities. I found myself running early in the morning, late at night, and sometimes squeezing it in while my son was at a birthday party. Then there was the weather. That would always through a wrench in it if I would have let it. However, after my habit was formed I just told myself it didn’t matter the weather, rain or shine, snow or ice, 100 degrees and humid or 0 degrees with a negative windchill, I would make sure to get my run in.</p>
<h2 id="around-the-neighborhood">Around the Neighborhood</h2>
<p>Something that I have enjoyed over the past 4 years of running is exploring my surroundings. In my neighborhood, I have found so many small parks, trails, and green spaces that I didn’t know existed in the first 6 years we lived there. Mostly because I would just drive by and not give it a second look. However, by increasing my mileage as well as the frequency of runs, I found myself exploring more places because I needed more routes and I was going farther.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Also, in my town and some of the surrounding areas, I went to other parks not near my house in order to find a new and interesting place to run. Some of which I then took my family back to so would could all explore at a later time to really take in the scenery.<br>

<p>Besides breaking in my new Asics pair of shoes as I feel I have gone through quite a few this past year. I might try to take a different approach for this next year. My goal is to get some longer runs in but feel I need to back off on the times per week in order to make that happen. Some of it is because of the time commitment which is partially due to my own schedule but also with the lack of daylight we have right it does add to the challenge. I am guessing it will be a slow transition as I have conditioned my body to run daily it is not super easy to just stop. Trust me I have tried. Till the next update get outside and start exploring your neighborhood.<br>

		<a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/09/05/north-finding-my.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-09-05 05:45:00 -0600">Sep 5, 2019</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This summer based on the suggestion of others I decided to read pick up the book titled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/North-Finding-While-Running-Appalachian-ebook/dp/B01N6Z44OZ/">North: Finding My Way While Running the Appalachian Trail</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/scottjurek">Scott Jurek</a> and Jenny Jurek. I always knew who Scott Jurek was but I for some reason I didn&rsquo;t really realize he had run the Appalachian Trail and/or wrote a book about it. So as a runner myself I figured this would be the perfect book to listen to. The book chronicles Scott’s 2015 attempt at the Application Trail FKT (fastest known time) that he made with the assistance of his wife Jenny.</p>
<p><em><strong>Overall, I would suggest “North” to anyone that enjoys running or hiking.</strong></em> Not to say if you didn’t enjoy running or hiking you wouldn’t find this interesting but I do think you can relate to some points in the story. However, if you want to hear more of my take read on!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/North-Finding-While-Running-Appalachian-ebook/dp/B01N6Z44OZ/"><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/83a9c91640.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The book is mainly from Scott’s point of view I did like the added benefit that Jenny’s views were intermixed in the book (as well as Audio) as well. It was interesting hearing what Jenny was thinking during the time as well as she could tell her husband Scott was hurting at times but also gave some insight into all that went on behind the scenes to assist while he was out running the trail. Also, the book is about so much more, you hear about their suffering, friendship, marriage, ego, and doubt.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the story, you are dropped into the picture with Jenny and Scott discussing life and what is next. Scott seems to want something else out of life as he realizes he has been on autopilot. He wanted to capture the uncertainty and excitement that comes with putting yourself into an extreme challenge. Not to mention, he and his wife Jenny were also mentally and physically drained by her second miscarriage. For them, Scott’s attempt at the Application Trail FKT was a way for them to try to escape and reconnect with themselves. However, they were not entirely sure what they had gotten themselves into.</p>
<h2 id="46-days---2189-miles">46 DAYS - 2,189 MILES</h2>
<p>Everyone already knows the outcome of the book so that is not a spoiler to any degree. However, where the pages start to come together is listening to how they overcame the daily struggles on the trail. You can tell the injuries, deprivations, and setbacks all take a toll on the overall push for and ultimate broken record. It is in those daily struggles that words of motivation and inspiration flow to the reader.</p>

<p>I listened to the Audiobook of this mostly while running of course :). I will say I really appreciate it when authors read their own books for Audiobooks, I think it adds something to it. Especially, if it is someone like Scott and Jenny that you have seen a picture of before and are a presence in the running community. It almost makes it feel like a friend just telling you a story.</p>
<p>I really find it easy to recommend this book as I think it is a great story to be told of his feat and you feel you are with both him and Jenny the whole way. Also, I found how the book was written can help motivate anyone to face a big obstacle.</p>
<p>Final note, if you are interested in more pictures and news from the actual event check out <a href="http://www.scottjurek.com/appalachian-trail">Scott Jurek&rsquo;s website</a>. Also, you can find a video that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVHF8FLUPGo">Brooks Running</a> made as well.</p>

			 <p>Something is New around here&hellip; Welcome to Up North!
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I am certain you have noticed that the blog has changed ever so slightly as it is no longer called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Still Thinking&hellip;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> In all honesty, nothing about the blog specifically has changed from a content perspective I just decided after a little over 4 years I wanted a new name and maybe a fresh start at this. So I</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I doubt anything will really change right now as I am enjoying the current non-specific schedule. I think if anything you will see some more writing about thoughts and experiences. In addition, I am sure I will just share some shorter things that might be of interest or making me think from time to time.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I was actually looking back at some of my earlier posts on this site the other day, and one post called &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Going back to the beginning<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; caught my attention. There is a sentence in there that probably sums up what this blog has been and might be for eternity.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am blogging as a way to share interesting stories and thoughts.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="ok-ok-i-get-all-of-that-but-why-up-north">Ok, ok, I get all of that but why Up North!</h3>
<p>I am sure at the time I was thinking about it I had a much better reason. However, it really came down to I wanted a change and something simple. I live in what some call the Bold North or that is how it was advertised during the Superbowl and it has kind of stuck around for some. Also, when I think of Up North, I think of someone spending time outside and that my friend is something I enjoy. After I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->refound my love of running<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I try to get outside almost daily now as it is almost like therapy. In addition, over this past year, I have made it a priority to explore more of the parks and trails around my city as I have regretted such a thing in my past life.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Sum all of that up and the name just stuck for me as it meant something.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
For those of you that have been with me for a while or if you are new here I am thankful no matter what. I hope everyone sticks around and as always leave me a comment if you have any suggestions, questions, or just want to drop me a note.</p>

			 <p><em>First I want to caveat this as there is not any detailed research or analysis done on this topic other than my own observations over the past week while traveling in China. In fact, I am currently writing this while flying back to the US and probably won&rsquo;t spend a lot of time editing it or polishing it up. Just some random observations.</em></p>
<p>People are always worried about how connected they are and how much they are doing things on their phones or devices in the US. My wife and I are included in this as we try to model good behavior of device usage at home and try not to be too dependent on it so we can be present for our kids. However, using my phone as a camera I knowingly pull it out of my pocket quite a bit so I can snap a picture of the kids or a beautiful landscape. I always feel I could do better here but after traveling for the past week I have started to realize our problem might not be as bad as we all think it is.</p>

<em>Photo credit <a href="https://travelsovertoys.com/">Travels Over Toys</a></em></p>
<p>I have spent the last week in China where I was both in Shanghai and Beijing. Below are a couple of observations I have noticed about device usage.</p>
<h4 id="walking-in-the-streets">Walking in the Streets</h4>
<p>While in China it didn’t stop me from running, even though my wife and mom thought I shouldn’t be out early in the morning running the streets of China. Not only from a safety perspective but air pollution as well. Don’t worry I am safely on a plane back to the US so all is well. On my first morning running, I noticed there was relatively no one out in the streets but it was bright enough outside to be 8 am back home. On that first day, 5 people almost walked right into me as they were deeply in thought of what was on their screen and facing down. Remember I was running and not being super stealthy trying to sneak up on anyone so they for sure had to have heard my feet hitting the brick pavement. You would think as that noise came closer to them they might consider looking up. However, not only did they not look up even when I was right next to them, they were just drifting along with their nose to the screen.</p>
<h4 id="eating-lunch">Eating Lunch</h4>
<p>Eating lunch with my co-workers the first day I remember glancing around the restaurant and everyone at every other table had their phones out and looking down. I won&rsquo;t say we don&rsquo;t do that in the US but it seemed like a lot more than where I live. Now some of this could just be Shanghai is a bigger city than the Minneapolis area and if I lived in a downtown setting I might notice this more often. That might be some of it but I am not 100% sure that is the whole reason as I have done my fair share of traveling in the US as well.</p>
<h2 id="my-take">My Take</h2>
<p>Whereas people in the US keep trying to make conscious efforts to stay away from their phones, China seems to be doing the opposite. The restaurant I was talking about earlier where everyone was on their phone some of it made more sense as I traveled more. You see in China even though you go to a restaurant and sit down, most of the time you end up ordering from your phone (thinking face). Yep, you heard that right, the people sitting at the tables and planning on eating it there ALL order and ALL pay by their phone. I can see some benefits on the payment side of things as you don&rsquo;t have to worry about them taking your credit card or dealing with cash. Also, I would assume a receipt would be instantly on your phone if you needed it for your records or business purposes. However, this whole situation is just another way to keep people engaged on their phone and not put them down.</p>
<p>In talking with a colleague on a different night, she explained that now she doesn&rsquo;t even carry cash or bank cards but just always keeps her phone on her. It sounds like everything is almost done by phones for them and that could be a major reason everyone seemed to be looking down. If you are in the habit of using it all the time for everything then it just becomes so ingrained in your daily life that you probably don’t even think about not looking at it when you are with others or completely alone walking the streets. It is a mere lifeline at this point in their culture as everything is becoming connected (kind of sounds like the Feed in the <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/05/14/breach-by-eliot.html">Analog Series</a> of books).</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/cb4a93c5bb.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="there-could-be-some-benefits-here">There could be some benefits here</h2>
<p>Even though this all sounds bad, I actually can’t believe how far along they have come technology wise. My last visit to China was 4 years ago and I still remember watching most people pay by cash or credit/bank cards. However, this time almost everything is digital and I was for sure an outsider paying by cash and credit card. They had to dust off the machine in the corner and even then a handwritten receipt was given to me as they didn&rsquo;t have a printer around. This is because most people in China just got it on their phones.</p>
<p>Even when traveling in Germany last year I found it interesting that they bring the payment terminal to your table and you watch them run your credit card. Those payment terminals needed to be connected in some fashion so they didn’t have to walk my card back to the main terminal. However, what I was noticing in China would be taking it one more notch up. They merely had a QR code somewhere on the table that you could scan and send the payment to if you didn’t already order from the phone.</p>
<p>As much as I don’t want to be so tied to my phone as I truly like putting it down once in a while. I would welcome having more things go digital like payments and receipts. I too do not like carrying my wallet around with lots of other stuff in it if I can avoid it. I can see that more things will be done by phone which will also require a lot more focus and discipline for myself to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t become the norm of always being on my phone. I want to be present and in the moment with my kids and not always be looking down at my phone. I do welcome this challenge as I really can see benefits.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think? Would having more things go digital be good or would you fear you would be tied even more to technology and it could bring bad habits along the way?</strong></em></p>

			 <p>Last morning in China as I fly out tonight so my last morning of exploring the streets. It still seems strange to find all of these little paths like this that are right around tall buildings and roads.

			 <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breach-Analog-Novel-Book-3-ebook/dp/B07HHY3MRM/">Breach</a>by Eliot Peper (<a href="https://twitter.com/eliotpeper">@EliotPeper</a>) was a great ending to the Analog series as it compliments both <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2018/04/01/bandwidth-by-eliot.html">Bandwidth</a> and <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2018/10/30/borderless-by-eliot.html">Borderless</a>. Not to jump too far to my conclusion but this is another great book by Eliot and I really enjoy how his books can stand by themselves but are also tied together to make a great series.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breach-Analog-Novel-Book-3-ebook/dp/B07HHY3MRM/"><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/aa568e2ada.jpg" alt=""></a>
<em>I was lucky enough to get an advanced copy to read but as I really do enjoy Eliot&rsquo;s writing I bought the Kindle and Audiobook version too in order to add to my growing collections of great books.</em></p>
<p>For the final story in the analog novels, Eliot further weaves the prior books of this series together by bringing back prior characters that some may have forgotten. This time, however, the people who long ago were manipulating the feed are the only ones capable of saving it as an activist group is trying to destroy the credibility and power it possesses.</p>
<p>A stranger in hiding discovers that this group of powerful people wants to destroy the feed and she knows she needs to do something about it.  The stranger has been in hiding for so long trying to forget about the missteps of her past life knows that what is being discussed could hurt those that she was close to. She must decide if it is worth it to come out of hiding to help her friends that she abandoned long ago.</p>
<p>Prior to this Emily, who had manipulated a backdoor to the feed had no thought of going back and reconnecting with her past friends and acquaintances but after stumbling upon this plot to hurt those people she knew she couldn&rsquo;t sit idle.  As she weaves her way back into the lives of those she abandoned she reflects on her upbringing and what brought her to where she is today.</p>
<p>Honestly, I could go on and on about the story but I think you should pick up a copy yourself to read as I don&rsquo;t want to spoil anything that might give away how it ends.</p>
<h2 id="attention-to-detail">Attention to detail</h2>
<p>As always, Eliot does great with the details. This is one of the many reasons I really enjoy reading his books. He writes in a way that paints a vivid picture of what the character is seeing, hearing and feeling as they go about the story. All of that further adds to the story as you feel you are part of the action.</p>
<p>Not to mention he does a great job drawing from current events and issues in the world today to bring this story that much closer to the very near future. Topics around student loans, schools effectiveness, and of course politics on a global scale just to name a few.</p>
<p>This story was tightly woven into the other two books of the Analog series by the characters, but Eliot also made sure the books could be read by themselves. Keep your eyes out for the easter eggs that he drops into the stories when he might reference other characters or places from other books he has written. I am sure I didn&rsquo;t catch them all but when I find something referencing a different book (not part of this series) it does put a smile on my face.</p>
<p>As with almost all of Eliot&rsquo;s books, I really enjoy the quotes and insights that are sprinkled about. In the various types of books I read, I don&rsquo;t normally pull out motivation from fiction books.  However, I am thinking Eliot does this on purpose as the character is normally trying to motivate themselves or others but the same statements can be used in everyday life. One that stuck out for me in this story is below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we&rsquo;ve been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a good book to read while enjoying the warmer summer months I would definitely suggest picking up this book as it will keep you wanting more. Not to mention if you have not read any of the books in this series I would suggest starting from the beginning as you can&rsquo;t go wrong.</p>
<p>I really do enjoy Eliot&rsquo;s books and his style of writing as you can tell. I can&rsquo;t wait to see what is up next for him as he continues to produce great work.</p>

<p>This quote has been sitting in my drafts for as long as I can remember. My day job has been kept me really busy prior to a quick family vacation earlier this week and an upcoming work trip next week. I ran across this quote again and it seemed like the perfect thing to share.</p>
<p>I am sure we can all relate to this quote as it seems like everyone always remembers when we missed something or made a mistake. It isn&rsquo;t that no one celebrates the wins and successes in our lives as well but most of the time those are short-lived and don&rsquo;t come around as often as we like.</p>

			 <p>We started out with some solo hikes / runs around the hotel. Then we went o the Sedona Airport Loop which had great views on the hike. It might have been a good idea to all turn back as it ended with two of us running in the rain. However, then we all claimed a lookout to take some pictures in the rain. Finally, we drove back to Phoenix (through hail nonetheless) and played games with Kent, and hung out with Great Grandma Gott before the big kids and I had to run to the airport. Such a great short trip with tons of family time.</p>

			 <p>I am no road warrior when it comes to traveling but I feel like over my 15+ year career I have traveled a fair amount. However, most of my travel comes in waves, a lot in a row and then nothing at all.</p>
<p>For example, right now I am currently traveling and will get back later this week. I will be home for 2 weeks then a vacation with the whole family where we will be traveling for about a week. Once I get back from that I will have a weekend with the family before boarding a plane again. That time, however, will be an international trip which always adds to some travel complexities.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/57633f4393.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I typically don&rsquo;t mind traveling except that I have to be away from my family and potentially miss activities of theirs. However, what makes things worse is the pending appointments of flight departures. The hurry up and wait of it all is really nothing special. I am sure I was annoyed with it when I was fresh out of college traveling but maybe I didn’t care as much now. Or it might have been because I was so much younger and didn&rsquo;t have anything else going on.</p>
<p>What makes that even worse is when you have a flight later in the day and your whole day gets sucked into making sure you can leave on time. Or even worse then you feel you can&rsquo;t do anything all day as you want to make sure you leave at the optimal time.</p>
<p>There are too many variables when flying that sometimes suck the enjoyment out of air traveling. Let’s start from the top and work through a couple of items that make the pending appointment of air travel less fun.</p>
<h4 id="getting-to-the-airport">Getting to the Airport</h4>
<p>Travel times, yep you know what I am talking about is there traffic and if so how bad is it? Should I drive or call a car? If I take Uber or Lyft, will they be on time? If I drive, how long will it take me to park and get to the airport?</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/4a4ceaf2af.gif" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="security-line">Security Line</h4>
<p>How early should I really arrive? What if the security line is really long and it takes over the allotted times.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/293b3f0619.gif" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="delayed-flights">Delayed flights</h4>
<p>The flight is delayed, should I leave later? Should I still go at the same time because remember that time the switch it to later and then the plane came in early and it wasn&rsquo;t as long as they said. How delayed do you think it will be? Will I make my connection? When will I get to my destination? Do you think the flight will be canceled? If so, how do I rebook or get a new flight?</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/feb573bc16.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>You see all of those questions that run through your head and then you have to calculate the time back to your starting point of leaving the house. Not to mention if you have a flight later in the day you keep thinking about it and wondering if the time you planned to leave for the airport is right or if you should go earlier.</p>
<p>Then after you think you have answered all of your questions for airplane travel, you realize you haven&rsquo;t consulted the <em><strong>Weather</strong></em>! Well, that throws a wrench into everything and you have to start at the top again to see how that might affect what you already decided on ideal departure.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/7cf496010d.gif" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>This seems out of place</strong>
Well hope you enjoyed these random thoughts while I sit in the airport for a 3 hr delayed flight that was supposed to leave at 8:30 pm but we are now not leaving till 11:30 pm and arriving around 2:30 am local time. Don’t worry though I only have an 8:00 am meeting to make sure I am awake for.</p>
<p><strong>Miscalculated or having time to Kill in the Airport?</strong>
Just as I was going to hit the publish button this came up in my feed so I figured I would share it in case you made a mistake in your calculation or are delayed 3 hours like I was, <a href="http://www.travelettes.net/10-ways-to-survive-a-long-airport-layover/">10 ways to Survive a Long Airport Layover</a> by Jodie from Travelettes.</p>

			 <p>Watching this video by Casey Neistat the other day brought a couple of thoughts to mind that I wanted to share. However, before I jump into my own thoughts I really think you should watch the video as he brings up some really good points on being Rich vs being Poor.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ROfBLx6bLZI" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="recap">Recap</h3>
<p>For a little recap, in case you didn’t watch the video but I really think you should, Casey boils it down to everyone has <em><strong>Life Problems</strong></em> which consist of Happiness, Love, Fulfillment, and Purpose (at a minimum). However, if you are poor on top of those problems you have the big gorilla which is <em><strong>Money Problems</strong></em> because you don’t know where you are going to live, how to put food on the table, take care of yourself when you are sick, or maybe even not sure how to get to your job without proper transportation.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/bfdfb325c4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If you are like me, you are going to look at that list and agree with him that it is kind of straightforward. Poorer people are worried so much about money problems that when rich people say they can’t find their purpose in life and that money can’t solve their problems, we all jump off the rails because money would solve our problems.</p>
<h3 id="so-lets-take-this-one-step-further-now">So let&rsquo;s take this one step further now….</h3>
<p>There are some people that are in-between this simple concept of <em><strong>Money</strong></em> and <em><strong>Life</strong></em> problems. In fact, most people probably fall in the middle of this easy example. I would take a guess that most of us think we have some sort of Money problems.</p>
<p>If we take a closer look at what we think are our money problems (or think we are poor), are we really just spending above our means. We feel we need a bigger house or extra vacations. Where in reality if we cut those out we could begin to look closer at those Life problems.</p>
<p>In the video, the article that Casey references is from the NY Times and titled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/21/magazine/elite-professionals-jobs-happiness.html">America’s Professional Elite: Wealthy, Successful, and Miserable</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/cduhigg">Charles Duhig (@cduhigg)</a>. One part of the article that jumped out at me was a quote from the guy who made $1.2M a year and felt defeated in life said he was locked into a lifestyle that made cutting his pay impossible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He had received an offer at a start-up, and he would have loved to take it, but it paid half as much, and he felt locked into a lifestyle that made this pay cut impossible. “My wife laughed when I told her about it,” he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That right there is the true problem of what we all feel when we have moved out of the Poor category (i.e., basic needs being taken care of), we get locked into a new version of ourselves that moving backward would feel like we failed. So our new version of poor keeps increasing with us. I am guessing most people could probably take a different job and still not be <em><strong>poor</strong></em> assuming they could get their spending and priorities in order of what is important. That is work that not everyone is willing to take and it is also something that does not change overnight. Not many people want to downsize their house or give up that yearly trip to Disney with the kids.</p>
<p>Over the past years, I have read a lot of articles from Personal Finance and Minimalist bloggers and the thing that always sticks out to me is the underlying topic of living true to your priorities. Some of that is figuring out what your “basic needs” or “minimum needs” are so then you can really figure out if changes can be made in your job/career to help you really tackle Life Problems that we all face.</p>
<h3 id="my-thoughts--take-aways">My thoughts / Take Aways</h3>
<p>I am not immune to this thing and it is something I always struggle with as I am sure most people do. My basic needs have been met so at the simplest form I really shouldn’t have any Money Problems. Moving past that, I boil it down to the two resources I have at my disposal in order to make my Life Problems either manageable or fixed.</p>
<p><strong>Time and Money</strong> are both resources at our disposal which is really all that is needed for most problems in our lives and possibly the world. The hard part is to figure out how to balance both of them in order to get an optimal outcome for yourself.</p>
<p><em>Note I said optimal outcome, as there is not always a perfect balance of having tons of money and tons of free time.</em></p>
<p>Each of these resources is needed for prioritizing things that are important to us. For example, if you continue to upgrade your lifestyle by buying the newest gadgets, bigger houses, and fancier cars because you feel it is the most important thing to do you might find yourself in a situation of having no way out. Similar to the guy in the story from the NY Times. All of your resources are being used to tackle a lifestyle you want to achieve and I am guessing that lifestyle gives you less time and money to find love, meaning, and happiness.</p>

			 <p>The Minimalist Home: A Room-by-Room Guide to a Decluttered, Refocused Life by Joshua Becker overall is a great book for anyone that is looking to declutter their house and has possibly never done it before or just needs some more encouragement. However, if you have read other philosophies on decluttering or are 80% there, this book might not be for you then.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Minimalist-Home-Room-Room-Decluttered/dp/1601427999/"><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/0f0bd7da91.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<h2 id="the-book">The Book</h2>
<p>Each part of the book is comprised of topics broken down into specific rooms to tackle and ideas that go along with it. Specifically, some of the chapters were around decluttering the following rooms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Living Room and Family Room</li>
<li>Bedrooms and Guest Rooms</li>
<li>Closets and Mudroom</li>
<li>Bathrooms and Laundry Room</li>
<li>Kitchen and Dining Room</li>
<li>Home Office</li>
<li>Storage, Hobby, and Toy Rooms</li>
<li>Garage and Yard</li>
</ul>
<p>The book did a good job of having a mix of tactical informing to get started, personal stories from Joshua, and then personal stories of others. I think each complimented the other and really enforced to the reader that you are not in this alone. There are people out there right now reading this ready to take the same steps as you as well as people like you who walked these same steps and here is their story, and mine.</p>
<p>In addition to the great steps and antidotes throughout the book, I really enjoyed the quick quotes sprinkled throughout. They are perfect to write down as a reminder of why you might be taking this journey.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Minimalism isn’t about removing things you love. It’s about removing the things that distract you from the things you love.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Joshua Becker – The Minimalist Home</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There is one thing I don’t remember from his other books and he called it a minimalism dividend. In short form, it is really just the savings or benefits you would get due to the fact you now have less stuff to take care of (e.g., maintenance cost of items). There honestly is so many benefits to living a more decluttered life and if you haven’t started your journey it could be hard to grasp. That is where this book does a good job of pointing out many of the benefits you could gain by reducing clutter instead of just organizing it nicely in a closet or storage facility.</p>
<h3 id="my-own-decluttering-thoughts">My own decluttering thoughts</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Never organize what you can discard.
- <em>Joshua Becker – The Minimalist Home</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From a personal perspective, that was one of the biggest things I learned through my decluttering process. I think back at all the time my wife and I were just trying to move things around in our house in order to be <em><strong>organized</strong></em>. Fast forward 10 years, with the knowledge we know now and we really just needed to get rid of stuff. I can’t even count the number of times we commented to each other that all we felt like we did was organize and move stuff around during our free weekends.</p>
<h2 id="only-downside">ONLY Downside</h2>
<p>The only downside to this book for me is that I have read a lot of what Joshua Becker has written in book form (e.g., <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/05/31/the-more-of.html">The More of Less</a>), stories from his blog <a href="https://www.becomingminimalist.com/">Becoming Minimalist</a>, in addition to taking his Uncluttered course. So from that token, nothing in the book was new to me and most of his personal stories were the same ones that I had heard before. That is why I said at the beginning if you are far along on a path to decluttering this book might not be right for you as it probably won’t be anything groundbreaking to get you to 100%.</p>
<h2 id="parting-thoughts">Parting thoughts</h2>
<p>Even though I have followed Joshua Becker for some time, one of the best parts of this book is to hear other people&rsquo;s stories. Since the other stuff was not new, I enjoyed all of the other stories and hearing how other people have approached it and then after they completed what it means to them today. As I said before if you are looking to declutter your house and need somewhere to start I would definitely pick up this book as it really does a good job giving you a room-by-room guide to getting you started. If anything, I feel Joshua Becker does a great job in this area anyway so I would suggest you check out his blog <a href="https://www.becomingminimalist.com/">Becoming Minimalist</a>.</p>

<p>This is a really cool idea of turning a short story into something different. It isn&rsquo;t really a comic book but something almost living by utilizing the technology of today to create and make the story more visually appealing. I enjoyed the story when <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2017/06/23/true-blue-a.html">I read it in 2017</a>, but the story combined with the illustrations and design make for an even more brilliant read.</p>

			 <p>As you can probably tell from other things I post about on Social Media or this site, I really do enjoy running. It is something that got lost on me for a long period of time in my life but has really made its way back into my daily routine over the last three of years <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/02/09/back-to-running.html">Back to Running</a>.</p>
<p>So you can only imagine that when I ran across this new YouTube video series by Ryan Van Duzer called Running with Ryan, you can bet I stopped what I was doing to watch this first episode.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/6f4db8fb62.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say it didn’t disappoint as his first guest was Scott and Jenny Jurek who were talking about their record-setting run on the Appalachian Trail as well as the value of doing hard things.  Also, they touch on Scott and Jenny’s book called North as the paperback is coming out soon. However, you can buy the Kindle, Hardback or Audio-book version right now from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/North-Finding-While-Running-Appalachian-ebook/dp/B01N6Z44OZ/">Amazon</a>. This has been on my want list for a while so after watching this I got the audio version as they said it is narrated by Scott and Jenny. I always find it interesting listening to audio-books that are narrated by the authors.</p>
<p>I would suggest you check out the first video in the Running with Ryan series and if you are like me I am sure you can’t wait till the next one comes out.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L3bcs9Rn12w" alt=""></p>
<p>Hope you enjoyed the video and be sure to help spread the word of this new series by sharing Ryan’s video as he does some amazing work. Another thing to note from the video that dawned on me again while writing this is during this whole run Ryan had to run while holding a camera. I know I commented on it before when he ran in the <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2017/04/13/the-caballo-blanco.html">Caballo Blanco</a> race, but it is still an amazing feat to hold it steady enough to get the shot and make sure everyone is in focus while running. Which for some people is hard enough already.</p>
<p>Finally, be sure to check out <a href="https://www.scottjurek.com">Scott and Jenny Jurek&rsquo;s website</a> as well as I am sure they will be up to more adventure in the near future.</p>

			 <p>Last year was spent focusing on things that mattered not only to myself but my family too. I felt overall it was a very successful endeavor that allowed me to improve my health, mental state, as well as family time.</p>
<p>Early on in the year we definitely decided to make Family a priority and carve out some time throughout the year. One of the first things that kind of popped up unexpectedly was that each kid got a mini vacation with a parent. My wife took our oldest and youngest to Arizona at different times as they coincided with other family events. Then I took our middle child on a daddy-daughter trip to Duluth where we spent time wandering around and exploring via kayak sea caves. Since I wasn’t at either of the Arizona trips, I can speak more to our trip to Duluth, MN and it was really fun. It was great to just connect one on one with our children since most of the time we have multiple around us.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Another trip that sparked after some of the initial kid/parent trips earlier in the year was with a weeks notice we decided to take a family road trip to Colorado. This was a big highlight for all as it was really last minute and we were able to visit a number of things along the way. As much as I know traveling by plane is much quicker, sometimes just jumping in the car and driving to destinations is well worth it. The journey is part of the overall experience and the kids still do remember it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Another first this past year was camping and spending a lot of time at the Iowa State Fair. I can admit it publicly that it was actually a lot more fun than I would have expected but then again it has not been a dream of mine to do like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wifes’<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. After experiencing it last year and seeing the pure joy on my kids faces every day even though most days we did the exact same things brought me joy as well. Not to mention days, weeks, and months after the Iowa State Fair, our kids keep talking about it and we also find them pretending they are at the Iowa State Fair when playing downstairs.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Focusing on my health and mental state kind of went hand in hand but didn’t really take shape till late this past year. What I found was running was not only good for my mental state but I know there are health benefits there too. In the fall, I really started to up my running from what was 2-3 times per week to every single day. It still kind of amazes me that I started it but more amazed that I have been keeping up with it for the past 6 months. My excuse has always been that I never had the time to run longer or more days in a week. It was really tough at first but then I got creative and also started to understand where I failed in the past and planned ahead in order to be successful.</p>
<p>Finally, besides everyone being healthy we welcomed a new member of our family this year after the passing of our pets the prior two years. So meet Lainey Lou the Miniature Petite Golden Doodle.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As you can see she is not as petite as she was when we first got her :) .</p>
<p>Everyone in the family loves her to death even though we miss our old pets. This has oddly enough been a little bit of an adjustment as we really did take advantage of a pet free lifestyle over the summer. Now that everything has changed, it is a good change but we are back to moring upfront planning to make sure Lainey can either come with us or has another place to stay.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If I am true to myself in this upcoming year I know this will be a challenge to keep but I am really up for it as it has been on my mind for a while.</p>

			 <p>It hit me that I have been consuming so much so fast that I haven’t had time to actually think about what it means. This is further expanding on the topic I discussed a while back titled <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Media Consumption<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I have listened to some great Podcasts and read some great articles. Some of them have great nuggets of information that I write to myself thinking I will expand on it soon. The problem is that I never have time to execute that idea. I just end up with pages of notes that I will never look back at because I am already consuming the next block of information.</p>
<h3 id="the-never-ending-stream-of-information">The Never Ending stream of Information</h3>
<p>As you can see from the picture below I have a podcast listening problem big time. Don’t get me wrong I like all of them but there is never enough time. Mostly I listen to podcasts while running. However, it is also really easy to just keep listening to these wonderful podcasts after I return from a run or during downtimes like walking the dog, walking into work, folding laundry, working around the house and the list could go on and on.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/6014fe90ed.jpg" alt="">
<em>View of my Podcast list from October 2018</em></p>
<p>Hence lies the problem that I might be consuming too much information versus creating my own output or reflecting on what I have heard. Every time I read articles, books, or even listen to books or podcasts I always have this great intention of sitting down at the computer and writing out some thoughts like I am doing right now. However, as you have noticed from my very sporadic posting schedule, I never quite get back to the creation side of things.</p>
<p>On a run a while back I was planning to hit a feat I had not done in a long time by cranking out a 6-mile run. About 2 miles in my Bluetooth headphones died and all I had was silence. It was a strange feeling but good strange. I was just listening to my breathing, my feet hitting the pavement, and animals making noises in the distance.</p>
<p>It made me think that maybe I do need to rethink when I consume vs create or maybe I just need times of silence. In fact, it might just be that I need more time to think through what I had been consuming instead of just going right on to the next book or the next podcast. It is almost too easy to just let the next in queue startup without even thinking about it or digesting what was said.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-next">What is next!</h3>
<p>Obviously, the answer is easy but sometimes you just need to hear other people say it for it to sink in. I think Cody Warner said perfectly in one of is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->daily vlogs<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from a while back…</p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stop Watching… Start Doing!  - Cody Warner<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I look for areas to improve on, this tweet I ran across below might be a good rule to follow.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h4 id="other-articles-on-this-topic">Other Articles on this Topic</h4>
<p>If you have been thinking about this too, or wonder what other people have to say on this topic I am sure there are a bunch of other articles you can find. Towards the end of 2018 I was hearing a lot of people talk about it. Below are two articles that stuck out in my mind and each are taking different approaches.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thinking about Attention<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> by CGP Grey<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>CGP Grey, where he talks about stepping back from the internet almost completely. I don’t disagree with his thoughts as I too feel my attention span may be affected by always being connected and getting bit-sized pieces of information instead of long-form. For me personally, I consume more long-form listening than reading and even though I try to actually read a couple of books a year it is a challenge for me to stay focused. Grey may be taking a drastic approach that I am sure will work well for him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A New Case for Unsubscribing from Nearly Everything<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Cait Flanders<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cait actually has more than the one article touching on this topic as if you follow her you know she started slowly taking steps back from how she consumed information from the internet. She is not completely stepping away from the internet and just focusing on what mediums she wants to “subscribe” to as a way to ensure she can focus on other projects that are important to her. In another article (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Why I’m Retiring from Personal Blogging<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) she wrote about intentionally creating space in our lives for things we want to do.</p>

<p>I have not entirely figured out the best way for me to scale back my information consumption but will continue focusing on it going forward. If you have started to scale back yourself what has worked well for you?</p>

			 <p>I have been at a standstill for the last three months since I had posted a hand full of new articles. As the days clicked by I finally decided I should really think about it as I would put pressure on myself to push publish but ultimately nothing ever happened.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/6e45bb9f83.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Now before I get too far along this isn&rsquo;t one of those I was too busy or I forgot about posting for the last couple of months. I will say there has been too much on my mind about the content to post and not enough time to finish it out.</em></p>
<p>I was excited to post the follow-ups for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Media Consumption<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Floodgates of Unnecessary Purchases<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as I had some more thoughts on each of those subjects. In fact, right now I have 5 posts ready to publish today if I wanted to but where I keep getting caught up is do I really want to publish them on this site or do I want to release them if/when I change this site name in the upcoming days&hellip; weeks&hellip; months&hellip; years&hellip; It seems like I keep thinking of changing it up and that keeps making me push out my timeline of posting stuff I already have done.</p>
<h3 id="over-thinking-might-be-the-problem">Over Thinking Might be the Problem</h3>
<p>I am not worried about the change in general but I am wrestling in my mind with what this site should be or what the new site should become. That is where I hit my standstill. Here is some of what keeps going through my head:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="so-what-should-i-do">So what should I do?</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/f076710431.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I was going to just pose this as a question to anyone reading if you have been in a similar situation or what other questions would you ask me? However, as I thought of what to title this random post I realized the word Standstill came to mind. It seemed fitting because instead of publishing what I write, I have just been at a standstill. No new site, and no new posts.</p>
<h3 id="looking-back-and-moving-forward">Looking back and moving forward</h3>
<p>At this moment, I realize that I need to pull back from trying to craft the articles that might do well and get shared across all of social media. In my current situation I just like writing about things I see, stuff that is making me think, or interesting stuff I find online. This is more of a creative outlet that was never started with optimizing my audience or more specifically making money. Looking back I didn&rsquo;t have a direction of where I wanted to take this it was just a place to share things.</p>
<p>Over the last two years, I realized I had lost that as I kept thinking I should switch my topics/publishing style to match some of the people I follow that are super successful. That is them and that is not me nor at this time do I really want it to be me. I don&rsquo;t want to be bound by what I post about as it would be forcing me to pretend in a way. I know it could be beneficial in the long term if I would just <strong>niche down</strong> but at this time that is not going to happen but I am sure common themes will be present in my posts.</p>
<p>Hope you stick with me as the future is unknown&hellip; 😉</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/44858eeb59.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I really like that quote as it does ring true for myself and probably many of you. Well, at least the thought that a decision we made previously might have led us down a different path which then causes us to stop and think. However, other times it is something small that came and went. In fact, every day you are faced with some sort of decision that will lead you to the path you are today and not to the path you maybe could be on.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I like that quote above is circling back to the life you want. You might think things haven’t turned out like you had hoped it would or you wish you would have done something different in your past. I am as guilty as the next person and I keep going back to things I maybe should have done or shouldn&rsquo;t have done. I am trying to get away from that as it isn&rsquo;t really healthy as you never really know what would have happened because you might have still chosen a different path again and been worse off.</p>
<h3 id="small-steps-forward">Small Steps Forward</h3>
<p>If you think about that quote again and think of it as making life choices to move towards a goal you would like. What is a small step you could take to move yourself to where you would like to be? You just need to start changing habits or creating habits that will move you to your life goal. That is the best place to start instead of thinking about what you might have missed out on because of the choices you made.</p>

<h3 id="how-has-it-worked-for-me">How has it worked for me?</h3>
<p>For me personally, I tried to do this last year and I will say for 9 months of this year I failed at the approach of small steps as I was taking too many small steps in too many different areas of my life which resulted in ZERO changes. However, about 2 months ago I spent some time really thinking about what I wanted my future to look like. Not necessarily the big dream future as I have always tried to think about it previously but just looking out a couple months to a year for things like family vacations, job, and fitness.</p>
<h3 id="second-attempt">Second attempt</h3>
<p>Fitness and vacation goals were easy to think about but the execution in those required focus on a day in and day out basis. This is where breaking those things down into little bits I could tackle has really paid dividends. Really it was making small decisions of prioritizing if I wanted to move to my goals of vacation and fitness or put my resources (time/money) into something else.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/6e5e350640.jpg" alt="">
<em>It takes small steps to reach the top or your goal. Take your time step by step.</em></p>
<p>For careers, this is a more difficult task as it isn&rsquo;t something that can be changed instantly as you are more than likely not going to quit your job today and hope for the best. For me this probably too a lot more energy thinking about as I know what I am doing today isn’t necessarily what I want to be doing in 5-10 years from now. So instead of just trying to shoot for the stars now, I had to think about what is either holding me in my current role or preventing me from getting into another role or a similar role at another company. The answer was easier than I thought but one that is oftentimes hard to feel like you can accomplish… Money and Experience!</p>
<p>This is where starting to take small steps today like saving more money as changes in careers might have you moving from a higher salary to a lower one initially. So making sure you can have more in the bank and in turn live off less will help make that move more achievable when the opportunity presents itself.</p>
<p>Gaining more experience can be more challenging depending on if you are changing careers or just wanting a similar role at another company. Either way, you probably need to get more experience or else you would already be in that new role. In both cases this can come from volunteering, experimenting on your own time, or trying to see if you can gain more skills for your next role in your current role.</p>
<p>As you can see from a career standpoint, it is definitely a bigger hill to climb but the process of taking small steps towards and the end goal of what you want is how you have to ultimately start it.</p>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>
<p>What keeps me moving is making sure I make decisions based on what I value or believe in as well as trying to stay positive. Knowing whatever decision I make I will own and do my best to keep the ball moving towards my goal based on my values. I know if I do that I will less likely keep wondering <!-- raw HTML omitted -->what if <!-- raw HTML omitted -->as I will have better reasons and purpose behind the path I choose.</p>

			 <p>Have you ever been gearing up for a trip and fell into the trap of buying a lot of things because of that upcoming “trip”?</p>
<p>Earlier this year I went on a 2-week business trip to Germany and the above scenario happened to me in the weeks preceding me leaving the US. It started with the question of how can I pack most efficiently as I didn’t want to check baggage through since I wanted to be somewhat mobile on the weekend. So as I was looking over my typical packing, which is normally pretty minimal as for a week travel in the US I use my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kelty-22632716BK-Versant-Duffel-Bag/dp/B015GXULLI/">Kelty Versant Duffel</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/dfc2c87ef8.jpg" alt="">
<em>I even pack my laptop in this bag on most trips in the US I take for work. Remember I love to run so there is running gear in there too!</em></p>
<p>However, knowing I was going to be gone longer and over the weekend, I knew I would use a little bigger bag but really wanted to try to squeeze everything into a small carry-on suitcase order to make travel from hotel to hotel much easier. So I decided to update my list a little bit before I knew it I was looking at my things and thinking there was probably something better than I could buy instead of taking similar items that I currently own.&lt;</p>
<h3 id="the-problem-started-brewing">The Problem Started Brewing</h3>
<p>While packing my clothes I got this idea that if I bought some pants that would be comfortable enough to wear walking around but still look nice enough to wear to work a couple days over the trip that would be money worthwhile. So what did I do, what everyone does when they want something by heading to Amazon. However, it didn’t stop there…</p>
<p>I wanted to work out so I was going to take some running shoes, however, the ones I had wouldn’t work for casual at work and running as they are bright yellow and pretty worn at this point. Speaking of shoes though, maybe I should just get some new casual / dress shoes so I might not have to bring my actual dress shoes. Don’t you think some new socks are in order too? Also, I didn’t want to take my two phones along (long story), so I needed to buy a new phone workout band for the time I was away. Finally, I needed a different phone charger as the long cord just wouldn’t cut it as I didn’t want all that excess cord in my pocket when it was charging on the go. Before I knew it I had a list of “<strong>Needs</strong>” that probably totaled more than $400 and in 2 days boxes started showing up from Amazon.</p>
<p>You see what just happened there, it was so easy for my mind to justify purchasing and elevated things from a “<strong>Want</strong>” to a “<strong>Need</strong>” prior to my work trip. Once I had my mindset on packing light, I opened the floodgates of unnecessary purchases and I ended up with things I typically wouldn’t have bought myself till it was absolutely necessary.</p>
<h3 id="backpedaling-to-my-frugal-self">Backpedaling to my Frugal Self</h3>
<p>In the end, I came to my senses before it was too late and started to backpedal on what was really a need for this trip. Thankfully all of the items I had purchased had free returns. I did still end up keeping some of them and I feel good about it to this day as I know I have used them every week since.</p>

*Walking down the steep steps of the Cologne Cathedral!</p>
<p>Ok, two more plugs as I am still running in those <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GU9N8HQ/">Asics shoes</a> above and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H9ME25G/">prAna pants</a> are amazing too. I can get by wearing them to work because they look good depending on what shirt I wear.</p>
<p><em><strong>When was the last time you were getting ready for something like a big trip and you all of a sudden let the floodgates of purchases happen?</strong></em></p>

			 <p>In my overall quest to minimize distractions in my life either by limiting the time I spend on social media or watching TV. Lately, I have noticed that I probably have been overconsuming in other areas, specifically Podcasts, Books (both Audio and Paperbacks), and online news articles and blogs.</p>
<h4 id="tv-isnt-my-problem">TV isn&rsquo;t my problem</h4>
<p>During my recent travels, I thought back to when I used to travel and I would get back to the hotel and turn on the TV to find random shows to waste the rest of the night away. I have found when traveling now, once I get back to the hotel in the evening I don’t even think about turning the TV on. To be fair, that is something I don’t do at home either but for some reason, I notice it more in Hotels as they always have this big screen right in front of the bed that you can see from all places of the room.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/374ea55f82.jpg" alt="">
<em>The TV in the room is just calling you, above the desk and right in front of the bed too.</em></p>
<p>The hotel I was at last time was a Suite which had two big-screen TVs that were so close together that using the remote on the one in front of the bed would also turn on the one above the desk. Note there wasn’t even a wall between these two rooms. Not to mention, some hotels I have stayed at over the past year even have my name on it asking me to log into all my other accounts almost like it is calling me.😄</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/870aaf52f4.png" alt="">
<em>Who needs two TVs this close together? NO ONE!</em></p>
<p>So what do I do instead of watching TV? Typically that is when I would read the latest Blog posts of people I regularly follow, listen to a Podcast or an Audiobook, or sometimes I will just lay in bed or sit on the couch and actually read a book. I typically don’t “read” books as often as I am listening to books but I still do find time to just sit and read books from time to time.</p>
<h4 id="what-types-of-media-do-you-consume">What types of Media do you Consume</h4>
<p>All of this other media consumption that I would typically say is better than watching hours of TV or spending hours browsing social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) I am now wondering if it should be cut back on as well. I have realized that I sometimes get so consumed in them that before I know it I have accomplished nothing else on my long list of things I would like to accomplish like writing (on this blog is a good point), creating something new, running (yes I am weird like that), or even calling a friend.</p>
<p>Everyone is always saying we spend so much time on Social Media and watching TV shows or movies online. However, how much time do we spend consuming other media, and is that starting to move towards an area of concern? I could easily make the argument that it is better than other things but it also is taking away from me doing something else I enjoy. I don’t have a good answer on that one but since it has crossed my mind I am definitely going to look closer and possibly keep track of how much time in a given week I spend on these other forms of information consumption.</p>
<p><em>In full disclosure, this post has been written since April and I keep coming back to it as I am not sure if I was ready to hit publish. I have added some parts here and there over the months leading up to when I actually hit publish but I finally decided to just hit publish and I am sure I will have more on this topic at a later point in time.</em></p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Borderless-Analog-Novel-Eliot-Peper/dp/1503904725/">Borderless</a>(which was released October 30th) by Eliot Peper (<a href="https://twitter.com/eliotpepe">@EliotPeper</a>) is a great sequel to <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2018/04/01/bandwidth-by-eliot.html">Bandwidth</a> that was released earlier this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Borderless-Analog-Novel-Eliot-Peper/dp/1503904725"><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/2ba3030f2a.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p><em>I was lucky enough to get an advanced copy to read but as I really do enjoy Eliot&rsquo;s writing I bought the Kindle version too in order to add to my growing collections of great books.</em></p>
<p>The story picks up where Bandwidth leaves off as groups are more aware of the true power that the feed can possess on the global civilization. The main character from the previous book, Dag, is living with Diana and he is no longer working as a lobbyist and spends his days coloring.</p>
<p>This story is from Diana&rsquo;s viewpoint, who is working as a freelance spy now that she has left the CIA. A subtle underlying story of the book is how Diana is trying to figure out how to avoid second-guessing herself, putting trust in others, all while battling mentors and others from her past. While she is dealing with her own internal struggles, she needs to stay sharp in order to put a stop to others taking over one of the world&rsquo;s most important resources.</p>
<h2 id="attention-to-detail">Attention to detail</h2>
<p>The one thing I have really enjoyed about this series is how it talks about the feed but never does Eliot really describe how the feed is connected to us or what it really is. I think it is great to leave that abstract out as we each have our own thoughts and images of what that might actually look like. Also based on how the characters in the book use/talk about the feed you continue to create in your mind what that looks like.</p>
<p>One of the things I appreciate about Eliot&rsquo;s books is the realistic characters, their struggles, and overall attention to detail. Even though the book is written in a near-future time, he used tools at his disposal to map/chart out what the world would have looked like and the paths the characters could have taken.</p>
<p>Also, as with all of Eliot&rsquo;s books there are hidden Easter Eggs for you to find where he may reference other books he has written. It always brings a smile to my face as I know it isn&rsquo;t always easy to tie books from different series together but a lot of authors do it.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a good book to read as the colder months are approaching I would definitely pick this book up as it really grabs your attention from the first page and keeps you wanting more.</p>
<p>Finally, Eliot has another book in this series that is schedule to be released in May 2019 titled &ldquo;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breach-Analog-Novel-Eliot-Peper/dp/1542044596/">Breach</a>&rdquo; that I for one am excited to see what is next.</p>

			 <p>Over my life, I have traveled to quite a few different airports in the US and overseas.  During most of my trips, I need to get a rental car in order to get to my final destination.  I just got back from my last trip and this really made me think about how the travel industry <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(looking at you Airlines<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) is moving in this direction of buy-ups. As always, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tripp and Tyler<!-- raw HTML omitted --> have done it again by giving everyone a glips into how it sometimes goes down.</p>
<p><img src="https://youtu.be/0FnltJ3GYus" alt="youtu.be/0FnltJ3GY&hellip;"></p>
<h3 id="my-thoughts">My Thoughts</h3>
<p>I have to admit as much as I enjoyed the video, I can&rsquo;t remember the last time I had rental car issues.  However, since travel frequently most companies have my profile on file that allows me to walk up and grab a car and drive away. Avoiding that discussion with a sales agent trying to get me to buy more. I remember when that wasn&rsquo;t the case and I felt they were trying to sell me every part of the car and all I got was the shell. I just remember being confused what was really included in the quote when I ordered the car.</p>
<p>Airlines are in this game as well but to varying degrees based on the airline, you travel. It seems more airlines are going in this direction as well and it is really disappointing but a the same time I get what they are trying to do. They are trying to make people feel they are getting a great price at the time of purchase only to find out it didn&rsquo;t include everything. The worst part is all of these &ldquo;fees&rdquo; really add up for airlines and more than likely going to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bottom line<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>It is very common these days that if you are not a regular flyer or have a credit card for the airline you are flying you more than likely will have to pay baggage fees. Some airlines are now going to start charging customers for full size carry on&rsquo;s depending on the ticket you purchase (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks <!-- raw HTML omitted -->United!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->) Then, of course, there have been the odd one from a while back where one airline was charging people to use the bathroom. Yes, the Bathroom. I believe that didn&rsquo;t stick around but you can see that you need to be careful when booking travel and make sure you know what you bought.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts? Do you think companies should just give you one flat cost and have everything included? Or should they give you a base price and then have you pay for upgrades / additional services.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bandwidth<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Eliot Peper (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->@EliotPeper<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) is definitely another page turner by one of my favorite authors.</p>
<p>*I was lucky enough to get an advanced copy to read but I also bought the Kindle version as well so needless to say it is definitely worth picking up as I still bought my own copy 🤷‍♂️. *</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/94d940955d.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Bandwidth wastes no time from the first page dropping you right into the action as it captivates your imagination of a world not that far into the future. You will quickly figure out that the main character Dag Calhoon, a lobbyist representing high-powered tech and energy executives, starts questioning the world he has been helping create. In this world, every person has a &ldquo;feed&rdquo; (like social media) that is always in people&rsquo;s minds and is integral to how the world works. As the story evolves, Dag stumbles upon a group of activists that have hijacked people&rsquo;s feeds in order to sway public options and global markets. He eventually is faced with big decisions as he tries to figure out what is right/wrong and whom to trust.</p>
<p>I would say Eliot has done a good job in changing the types of books I have been custom to over the past couple of years. Where three years ago I would have said I read more Mystery or Action-Adventure and typically would have stayed away from Sci-fi type books. This book (like some of his others) is not what I would consider your typical Sci-fi books but more &ldquo;near-term sci-fi&rdquo; as it seems more within reach in the next decade.</p>
<h3 id="the-future-feels-closer-than-you-think-these-days">The Future feels closer than you think these days</h3>
<p>Even though this is a future-looking book, with everything in the news these days around political, environmental, and social media control issues it almost seems closer than you think. This book has them all and intertwines them into a great page-turning novel.  As always with Eliot&rsquo;s books, this is a very fast-paced story with a lot of twists and turns to make you really think. Not to mention the precision of detail he puts into describing the situations, buildings, food, and drinks that paints a perfect picture of what you should be seeing. Finally, I appreciated the short chapters as I always find myself with interrupting children when finally find time to sit down and read.</p>
<p>I really can&rsquo;t recommend this book enough and as always don&rsquo;t want to give too much of it away. So I would suggest you go <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pick up a copy today!<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>To make sure you don&rsquo;t miss out on his next books and sequel to Bandwith titled Borderless, be sure to follow him on Twitter (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->@EliotPeper<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) and subscribe to his newsletter from his website (<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.eliotpeper.com/">http://www.eliotpeper.com/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<p><em>As I mentioned I have read some of Eliot&rsquo;s books before and wrote about them so if you are interested to check out some of his other books go for it as you won&rsquo;t be disappointed!  Here are a couple: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->True Blue (A Short Story)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Neon Fever Dream<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Uncommon Stock: Power Play<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Uncommon Stock: Exit Strategy<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</em></p>

			 <p>Wow is it really that time again? Time to end another year and start the next.</p>
<p>It really seems strange to say goodbye to 36 and hello to 37. I think saying 37 seems so odd to me as it is that much closer to 40 and 30 seems so long ago.</p>
<p>This past year was one of the big ups and big downs. The family road trip that we took from Minnesota to Maine last summer was a huge success and the kids had a blast. In fact, the fear of the 26-hour car ride was very eventless as there wasn’t much complaining by the kids (or parents) at all on the way out or the 2-day trek back. Our family is definitely ready to hit the road again and are making plans for a West Coast trip in 2019.</p>
<p>This past year I did do a good job of slowing my own busy schedule down in a couple of areas (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Slowing Down to Redirect<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). I am going to continue to focus on this going forward as I want to challenge myself in the time I spend in various side/volunteer projects and make sure I am getting out of it what I would expect.</p>
<p>However, this year brought on more sadness as 13-year-old Yorkshire Terrier <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PJ<!-- raw HTML omitted --> passed away and now for the first time in 14 years, we don’t have any pets in the house. It feels very quiet and I do miss having a four-legged friend following me around from time to time but I am not ready to get another one yet.</p>
<p>Additionally, not long after that, I had to say goodbye to my Grandma as well. It is not the first death I have ever had to deal with but it was one of the firsts where I actually went to see her days before and tell her goodbye in person. When the person is completely coherent and knows she is waiting for the time, it makes it that much more surreal when you take a step back. There is always things you wish you would have done with the person or talked to the person about before that point but it give you one last chance to say something to them that you know they are hearing and responding to you about.</p>
<p>Right after both of those sad events, I pretty much boarded a plane and had to spend two weeks in Germany on a work trip. I felt bad leaving my wife and kids for so long but it was an experience that I really enjoyed and can’t wait to take my wife to Germany in the future. Almost all of the trip was work-related but over the weekend I spent my time in Cologne which was amazing. It is mind-blowing how much history can be in one city and how far back some of the buildings (and ruins under the city) date. My last whole week in Germany was spent working in our Berlin office, that also was also very interesting as there is so much history in that city from WWI, WWII and the Berlin Wall. In fact, it was interesting just talking to the people at my company that lived through the time the wall was up and how it affected their families.</p>
<p>Towards the end of 2017 and into the start of 2018, my new word that will carry me through is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->focus<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I guess you could say year 37 will be the year of focusing… On what you ask? Nothing particular and everything :)</p>
<p>I am looking forward to what 37 will now bring to me I know there will probably be new adventures and changes of some sort. Describing it as the year of focus will definitely mean that certain things will need to change as I am focusing in on various areas of my life that are most important to me. As always some changes will be quick and others will be a long game approach but setting the steps today for later down the road.</p>
<p>I look forward to checking in next year&hellip;</p>

			<h1><a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2018/03/02/blogging-meetup-year.html">Blogging Meetup - Year 2 Project Check-in</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2018/03/02/blogging-meetup-year.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-03-02 06:13:00 -0600">Mar 2, 2018</time></a>

			 <p>Year 2 has come and gone… As I am excited to see another year of people using the Blogging Meetup, I hold back a little bit as I know I have been very distanced from it in the last year as I was working to prioritize various extra projects in my life last year.</p>
<h4 id="look-back-at-year-2">Look back at Year 2</h4>
<p>My thoughts haven’t changed though as I really enjoy this little side project and I intend to keep it around. In fact, as of today, we have 450 people registered on the site. That is up 67 from last year where we had 383 users on the site. Maybe when we hit 500 we should have an online party :)! Now only because I am a numbers guru I want to show you the stats of the last two years by month. As you can see it is trending down and in about August last year it started declining faster. In fact, February this year looks like it will only be about half of last year.</p>
<p>![](<a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/c3365db595.png">ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2&hellip;</a></p>
<h4 id="peeling-back-the-numbers">Peeling back the Numbers</h4>
<p>I didn’t need to dig into the site stats to produce the chart above as I already had an idea of what the results were going to be. If you have looked at the site a couple of times in the last months it is mostly the same handful of people posting over and over. Not that there is nothing wrong with that as I am glad people are using it as established and it seems like there is another handful of users that look at the site on a daily basis. However, I still find it troubling that there is less engagement on the site than I hoped there would have been. Though for that problem of engagement, I hold myself accountable for a good portion of the blame as I know that there need to be more “things” (e.g., prompts, events, topic discussions) or things to get people engaged in the site. In fact, over the past year, I slowly had forgotten to keep up with the Like, Follow, Share Monday prompts. I think that generated good engagement for readers and hopefully gave some bloggers a nice bump in stats are people were going to check out their site.</p>
<p>On the positive side of things, I was happy to finally finish the <a href="https://bloggingmeetup.com/memberposts/">Members post page</a> which is really just an RSS feed from all members sites. However, on the flip side, I am not sure if people have found it useful or worthwhile. Some of that is I am not able to get any stats from it so unsure if links are being clicked on or not.</p>
<h4 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h4>
<p>So that brings me to today where I have been neglecting this site and trying to figure out what to do next. I would love to get feedback from anyone on what they think should be done with this site. Nothing is a bad idea as I still think a Blogging Community makes sense but maybe this implementation/version of it isn’t working anymore. Maybe the site needs to be more like a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/">BuddyPress</a> that can be more conversational, or forum-based like <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-discussion-board/">Discussion Board</a>, or maybe even just a big <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> group.</p>
<p>In the short term, however, I am going to figure out a way to kick off the like follow share again but maybe I will try to incorporate it with the RSS feeds from members' sites in order to get people looking at something that is newly posted. Over the next several months I am going to really take a hard look at the Blogging Meetup and see where this site should be taken. I am going to hope for feedback from the community as I don’t want to just make this decision alone.</p>
<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>
<p>Year two was still a good year for the Blogging Meetup as people were still using the site as it was originally intended. However, during the beginning of year 3, it is time to figure out what the next chapter of this site is going to look like to make sure it is still meaningful to everyone going forward.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think the next year of the Blogging Meetup should look like? Would you like to help it grow?</strong></em></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A little over a week ago we had to make another tough decision in our house as our last dog Princess Jezzabella the Diva of Pink aka PJ was put down. It was honestly like deja vu all over again as my wife and I have talked about it since the passing of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tucker<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a year and a half ago. We honestly never thought PJ was going to survive without him but she proved us wrong. In fact, I feel like she changed her normal behavior of a dog who kept to herself into one wanting more attention and love from us than ever before.</p>
<p>PJ had been with us for 13 years, with another birthday knocking on the door this June 21st. She was the second of our &ldquo;kids&rdquo;, and she has lived in Michigan (where we got her from), Illinois and Minnesota. It was a really tough decision to make, one that we thought two years ago would have been easier than it really was. However, with the different version of PJ over the last couple of years becoming closer with our kids and the fact that we would then soon be a household with no pets for the first time in the last 15 years.</p>
<p>In these final weeks she was throwing up almost daily and her breathing was sounding labored. This was on top of her eyesight fading as well as her hearing is going as well. So she would often bark at us and get scared as people would move around the house or come near her. Not that we will ever know how much pain she was in but we could tell she was not enjoying life as she knew it anymore.</p>
<p>We believe our decision was right as we saw her health declining we didn&rsquo;t want her to suffer from day to day. Also, selfishly we didn&rsquo;t want her last days to be ones where we would be angry that she was throwing up all over and barking at us constantly.</p>
<p>As with our first dog, we wanted to be with her until the end and in our minds, that was again non-negotiable. We ended up using the same place that comes out to your house and performs the procedure with you being able to be right next to them.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Finally around 5:20 we got the knock on the door and we knew that our time was finally up. It was a little harder this time as we knew what was going to happen and who knows PJ probably knew as well. I am glad that we could be with her the entire time as I still think it would be just as hard dropping her off someplace and then turning around and walking the other way.</p>
<p>PJ, you truly were an amazing dog and I will miss you dearly. You never were the super cuddle bunny that Tucker was but you stepped up and filled that void in a time we needed it most. In fact, maybe it was always in your nature but you just let Tucker fill that role as you liked to be the ferocious protector. Thanks again for the times you were there for me and making my life a little bit better/more exciting. You will always be remembered.</p>

			 <p>I can&rsquo;t believe today would have marked my 6th consecutive year of helping out with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->US Pond Hockey Championships<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (USPHC). However, due to my travel schedule this year I will be unable to help. Instead, I am getting ready to fly back to Minnesota this morning from a work trip. As sad as it is to break such a good streak and tradition, I figured I would reflect back on my prior times volunteering and how I came to be a volunteer 6 years ago.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So you decided to take a day off work and volunteer to stand on the ice for 8 hours in what could be really cold January weather?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Fair question, this probably piqued my interest more as I had just acquired the used materials for a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->backyard rink<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and was in the process of getting it ready for the cold. So as I was hearing about and seeing all of these pictures online of skating in the middle of a lake on an actual pond, I now wanted to see this event in person and watch some games.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Quick side story, I grew up in Iowa and have never played hockey in my life or really ice-skated in any prolonged amount of time. I used to rollerblade and play roller hockey in the street but nothing on the ice.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>If you have made it this far and want to see what it looks like check out the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->US Pond Hockey Championships YouTube channel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as they have some amazing videos from 2016 and 2017. I hope they put one out again this year as they get some amazing shots of the games and tournament. I am looking forward to hopefully helping out again next year as I always have a great time volunteering. Oh, and did I mention they give out some good hats. ?</p>

			<h1><a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2018/01/18/break-the-twitch.html">Break the Twitch, The Book by Anthony Ongaro</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I just finished reading <a href="http://amzn.to/2EWS9Mn">**Break The Twitch: a practical guide to minimalism, intentional living &amp; doing more of what matters by Anthony Ongaro</a>** and it is the perfect book for anyone looking to make a change in your current habits.  I had hoped to finish it right after it came out in December but got caught up in work stuff as I wanted to make sure I could really take time off around Christmas and New Years.  Hindsight 20/20, it is probably a good thing I didn&rsquo;t finish it in December as I would have cringed even more every time a box with specific markings on it arrived at my doorstep before the holidays.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/3bcfe47b22.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="breaking-the-twitch">Breaking the Twitch</h4>
<p>One of the great things I like about this book is that it really sets the stage early on as the quote below is the first line of the introduction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People don’t buy products—they buy better versions of themselves.&lt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book in my mind gets separated into three different parts :</p>
<ul>
<li>The introduction of the book is where Anthony talks very specifically about how digging into his Amazon purchasing history he was able to figure out that he was buying so much stuff on a whim. He also briefly dissects some of the purchases he made and his rationale prior to the purchases compared to the actual outcome.</li>
<li>The second part of the book is where he starts to give more detailed examples and ideas to help you the reader identify places in your life where you might be doing things impulsively. Also, how those impulses can create some really strong habits as he found out personally. Finally, he brings up how technology has maybe helped play a huge role in fostering the habits.</li>
<li>The final part of the book really brings everything together and talks about strategies to take for breaking bad habits (or Twitches). Additionally, it talks about Minimalism and how that can help play a role in breaking and creating new habits.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though the book has the underlying true story of Anthony&rsquo;s Amazon purchases, what he discovered helps provide specific examples of correcting and uncovering bad habits. So if you are you thinking of changing some of your habits this year, the book lays out some good approaches he took for Breaking the Twitch. As you can tell I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone. With that said, most of the stuff in the book isn&rsquo;t rocket science, and the themes of what he is saying most people already know. In my opinion, the value or what sets this book apart is that he does a good job breaking his thoughts down into bits that can be easily tackled.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h5 id="my-running-story">My Running Story&hellip;</h5>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest if I said we should run a 5k next month, and you haven&rsquo;t run for over a year, your head might spin. At the time it would seem like such a hurdle to climb and you might not even know where to start because you&rsquo;re too focused on the end result and not what could you do <strong>TODAY!</strong> Or as it is described in the book the Minimal Viable Action.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Minimally Viable Action—the smallest, most immediate step you can take that is doing what you want to do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For my example, I was that person, and a couple of years ago I decided to just go out and <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/02/09/back-to-running.html">run</a> (in the dead of winter at that) with my non-GPS watch, my old pair of running shoes, and whatever other cold-weather workout clothes (or layers) I could find. I told myself I would run two blocks but after being out there I made it much further and then the next time I made it farther until having to walk. Each time I made it longer and sometimes faster until eventually it was just a habit and I was feeling healthier and had a good routine. When the month was up I realized I had already run a 5k and running another one wasn&rsquo;t going to be an issue.</p>
<h4 id="some-final-thoughts">Some final thoughts…</h4>
<p>Reading a book like this helps give you motivation and encouragement as you reflect on yourself. Knowing that you are not alone and others, though on different paths have probably been faced to walk down a similar path.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember that simplifying your life and designing a space that aligns with your intentions takes time—as the old adage goes, it is a journey, not a destination.
- <em>Anthony Ongaro, Break the Twitch</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, don&rsquo;t just take my word for it since you can read some of the book before you buy, Anthony has posted the introduction chapter of his book on his site which you can find <a href="http://www.breakthetwitch.com/book-introduction/">here</a>.</p>
<p>To learn more about the book and see what others had to say check out Anthony&rsquo;s book page on the Break the Twitch site <a href="http://www.breakthetwitch.com/book/">here</a>. If you want to see/follow along with more of Anthony&rsquo;s work you can find him on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/breakthetwitch">@BreakTheTwitch</a>, his <a href="http://www.breakthetwitch.com/">website</a>,  and or his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyicqwQM9aIZ9mAw5xP4Q2g">YouTube</a> channel. I have been following along since 2016, where during my running example above I wrote about the <a href="/2016/02/19/power-of-the.html">Power of a Habit</a> and linked so some of his older posts which helped motivate me at that time to push through.</p>

			 <p>Have you ever wondered which WordPress platform is right for you? Maybe you are just curious what some of the differences (pros and cons) between WordPress.com and WordPress.org. I am going to walk you through my most recent thought process because after using WordPress.com for the past two years I am moving it back to the self-hosted WordPress.org.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/a7d9b7febc.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I loved the ease of which WordPress.com just works and you don&rsquo;t have to worry about anything in the back end. If your goal is to just start writing and see where it goes I would recommend it. There is no hosting provider to find, no installs, no plugins, no making sure you backup data, no worrying about indexing, no worrying about SEO optimization or anything. You just walk through the steps on WordPress.com and create a site. The only time you need to think a little bit more is if you are actually going to pay for a domain name or pay for some of the other upgrades.</p>
<p>Two years ago I wrote <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wordpress.com or WordPress.org and Why?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which outlined at the time my thoughts and reasons of why I was moving my self-hosted WordPress.org site to WordPress.com. The big reason as I touched on before was I just wanted to Write/Post. I didn’t want to get caught up in worrying about other things because at that time I didn’t care. WordPress.com makes it super simple to Like, Comment, and Follow other blogs. It really can make a new Blogger feel good about the progress you are making and honestly who doesn’t like knowing that people have read their stuff.</p>
<p>However, all of those easy features come with limitations. You realize that you can’t use Google Analytics in the cheaper versions, add some custom code linking to other forms or email captures, further tweaking of how themes look and work. I think when you get to that point you really need to consider moving off of WordPress.com unless you want to pony up to the Business Version. Here is a quick rundown 2 years later of my pluses and minus of each:</p>
<h4 id="wordpress-breakdown">Wordpress Breakdown</h4>

<td>Hosting</td>
<td>Find a website host**, domain name, and perform all maintenance yourself (e.g., backups, security, upgrades, and optimizations).</td>
<td>Premium hosting and maintenance is taken care for all Plans (i.e., security, backups). Upgrade for custom domain names (e.g., StillThinking.me).</td>

<td>Support is available in the community  forums. Upgraded plans to have email and live chat access.</td>

<tr>
<td>Analytics</td>
<td>Powerful analytics using Google Analytics by adding custom code in your theme or installing a free or paid plugin.</td>
<td>Limited analytics with their own built-in stats. No Google Analytics capabilities. Upgrade to the Business Plan for Google Analytics integration.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SEO</td>
<td>Install the best free or paid SEO plugins in order to unlock tools needed to maximize your SEO potential and achieve a higher Google search results.</td>
<td>Limited to no SEO control with most of their plans. Upgrade to the Business Plan for tools to maximize your SEO potential.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sharing</td>
<td>Install plugins in order to access popular features and customize to have complete control. Now you can enable WordPress likes for posts and comments via JetPack! <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><em>The only limitation to WordPress.com is Post Tags are not searchable in WordPress.com Reader.</em></td>
<td>Popular features standard but with limitations such as Social Media integration, Limited email subscribe lists (only popups via MailChimp), Likes and Comments integrated for all WordPress.com users, and Tags show up in WordPress Reader searches.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>** - <em>Most website hosting providers usually feature 1-click WordPress installs that makes it that much easier now to just start writing!</em></p>
<h4 id="some-final-thoughts">Some final thoughts…</h4>
<p>Now that my site has been completely transitioned over I have been starting to find a couple things that show up differently.  However, the nice thing is most can be tweaked/fixed with the right amount of Google searching. I still feel really good about my decision as it has also allowed me more control in other initiatives that I am trying to work on like building a Still Thinking On the Line&hellip; newsletter!</p>
<p>I hope you found this article helpful in understanding some of the differences that I have noticed between both of them. There have obviously been other articles written about this in much greater detail on the pros and cons.  Here are two of my favorites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/com-vs-org/">WordPress.com and WordPress.org</a> by Wordpress.com</li>
<li><a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/self-hosted-wordpress-org-vs-free-wordpress-com-infograph/">WordPress.com vs WordPress.org – Which is Better?</a> by WPBeginner</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you have a WordPress.com site or have had one in the past, I would enjoy hearing your thoughts as well.</strong></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In our journey of living a more intentional life by decluttering our belongings and owning less. We have recently found out that house projects have helped us make larger strides in this overall journey.</p>
<p>Owning an older house provides you with lots of fun opportunities to work on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->projects<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that might include: updating rooms by painting or carpeting; discovering issues or fixing leaks that need a professional or home handyman; or even just finding a room that needs a full remodel like an outdated kitchen.</p>
<p>My wife and I have done all of the above over the last 9 years we have lived in our house. The worst part of any housing project is that you have to move all of your belongings from the area the project is taking place to another area. For most of our house projects up till a couple years ago, we would move everything from one place to another and then move it ALL back once we were done.</p>
<p>However, in the past couple of years, my wife and I have realized that we need to use those disruptions in our normal space and be very mindful of what we put back once it is all done. In looking back, we have probably moved every piece of furniture, toys, books, boxes, pictures, or other items from one room to another as kids changed rooms and home projects happened. It would have made too much sense during those moves to time to take the extra couple of minutes to set things aside and only slowly add back what is truly needed.</p>
<p>It probably wasn&rsquo;t until this latest project of our Kitchen remodel that we really took hold of this idea. We moved everything out of our Kitchen, Dining Room, and Living room as we had the wall separating all of those removed. It was a messy process that allows our family of 5 to get really cozy in the basement that only has 2 bedrooms.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the process by which we packed everything away but the couple single sets of kitchen stuff we needed follows that of what Ryan from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Minimalists<!-- raw HTML omitted --> described as a <strong>packing party</strong>. However, I am always under the mindset that you don’t really need a term or reason, you just need to figure out what works well for you. We are still on this long journey of slowly decluttering room by room and figuring out what makes sense for our family of 5 as we cannot take on too much at once or it would be utter chaos in our life.</p>
<p>Once our kitchen was finished and it was time to move everything back in we only moved in things we needed and made sure it had a purpose. For the kitchen, this was really easy as everything was in boxes we only brought stuff out that we used for cooking on a daily or weekly basis. A couple things we noticed during this process were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coffee Cups (or drinkware)</strong> - I love coffee but really who needs to have around 30 coffee cups. I am not sure who we were planning on inviting over for coffee or hot chocolate but we realized that was way too many.</li>
<li><strong>Tupperware</strong> - How can we have so much of this and nothing matches. Where did all the lids to the small-sized containers go and why am I stuck with so many large lids with no containers. Let&rsquo;s just say we didn’t keep a lot and have paired this down so we can always find a lid and dish.</li>
<li><strong>Cooking Utensils</strong> - Don’t get me wrong it is always great to have a spare but I am not sure we needed 10 spatulas. It was more than likely we only needed 2-3 as we used the same one most of the time.</li>
<li><strong>Mismatched stuff</strong> - During our cleaning out we found lots of plates, cups, and other items that were not a full set even though we had one full nice set already. These were perfect candidates to not work back into the cycle as one cup isn’t as good as a nice set of 12.</li>
</ul>
<p>There were lots of other examples of that were we just had lots or multiples of items that we didn’t need to continue to keep around cluttering up shelves or drawers.</p>
<p>In the living and dining rooms, our goal was to remove excess furniture and things on the wall to get a more minimalistic look. By removing excess furniture and having floor space, it allows us to now clean up more quickly. Not only is it a new space, where I enjoy the open floor plan, but I really enjoy having less stuff in the room. I feel like a burden has been lifted off us and it seems much more peaceful to enjoy. As I look around there is less to clean around and more space to just have fun with the kids and not have it feel so cramped because of the stuff we owned. One of the bigger changes we made during this time was to not keep any toys in the upstairs living room. That doesn’t mean the kids don’t bring their toys there to play or use the dining room table to draw, color, or play with play-doh on. It really just meant that we didn’t want that stuff to be stored in the living room as we found before that led to creating more mess. To accomplish this, we made sure those items previously stored in the living room that the kids wanted to keep had a place in their bedrooms or the toy room downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>Before:</strong>

<p><strong>After:</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/68d5d1d465.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>As you can tell we couldn’t be happier with the space and are looking forward to enjoying it for years to come. Even though the remodel was a big project in itself, I feel a great side effect of it was that we were able to pack everything away and then Intentionally choose what to bring back into our living space.</p>
<p>Once we had our living space set up as we liked it and brought back the items we felt were a good fit in our life, we donated the rest. This is another crucial step as you don’t want to be hanging on to boxes or stuff in another place of the house. I understand that you might not want to get rid of those items right away and if that is you, I would suggest you set a calendar reminder to find that box(es) buried in the garage that you need to donate at a specific date in the future.</p>
<p>Have you had a housing remodel or project in the past and found it a good time to declutter items? If so I would love to hear how it went for you and if you think it was successful. If not and you have a project on the horizon let me know about it and share your success after it is all done.</p>

			 <p>Becoming more focused requires an even greater skill at keeping your focus.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As I have been trying to write more, I have realized that sometimes when I am about to call an article (or topic) good and close my document for the day&hellip; Another idea pops into my head and I then start writing out words and thoughts about that topic. In fact, it is happening right now as this is the third blank document that I have started writing today and each topic is different but related.</p>
<p>I always find it interesting when and how ideas come and go. There will be times when I just sit and stare at a blank screen wondering what I could write. I have a whole bunch of ideas but they don&rsquo;t interest me at that specific time. Then there are other times where I am writing away and going to call it good for that topic only to jump over and start a new topic because I am in the zone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone should write a blog, every day, even if no one reads it. There’s countless reasons why it’s a good idea and I can’t think of one reason it’s a bad idea.&rdquo; - <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Seth Godin<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Unmistakable Creative Podcast <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To that point, I couldn&rsquo;t agree more when people say to <strong>just write every day</strong>. Just let the words flow out on-screen (or paper) even if it is something you will never publish. The worst thing that happens is that you spent some time writing. The upside, however, is that you just crushed it and wrote a whole bunch of amazing content.</p>
<p><em>Now to flip the discussion</em>… <strong>Is it a bad thing to write about different topics and have a lot of them going at the same time?</strong></p>
<p>I would say I fall into this camp and I am not sure if it is a good thing or not. The only downside I can see right now is that I write a little bit about each of the topics I am working on and never fully finish any of them. Because I keep jumping around from one to the other adding a sentence here or there or just rereading my thoughts.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when I get to a point of not knowing what to write, I have some drafts already started that I might be able to just pick right back up where I left off and hopefully complete it.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you do in order to keep focused on your current writing or the drafts you have going?</strong></em></p>

			 <p>Sometimes things happen (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Crash!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) and it is something that you don&rsquo;t or aren&rsquo;t really sure if someone is going to tell you to try again. Or give you that extra encouragement/voice you need to get back up and try it again. After that post, I wasn&rsquo;t up to what I had hoped for motivation as I struggled to motivate myself in the least.</p>
<p>My instincts were telling me to continue to plug away at this injury slowly and that it was for some reason important to overcome this so I could get out and run like normal. In July I tried again to just get out and run but honestly, I had even less motivation to do that as I blamed my upcoming family vacation and the extra work I needed to do prior to vacation as my crutch.</p>
<p>Then we were finally during the middle of our family trip to the East Coast, and something deep inside me had me throw in my running shoes. Thankfully I did as after nine days into the trip, our final day in Boston before we headed up to Maine, I laced up my shoes to hit the streets. For some reason, I was up really early and figured now is the time to get out and just run around the neighborhood and see the sights of this city I don&rsquo;t live in.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2024/addd11298b.jpeg" alt="A historic brick building with a white clock tower stands out among modern skyscrapers on a city street with traffic signals and crosswalks."></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2024/image.jpeg" alt="Cobblestone pavement with varied stone sizes and colors, with small weeds and leaves, indicating an outdoor setting."></p>
<p>I am really glad I did! I was able to see the places I had seen the day before but with no one else in sight. In fact, it was just so peaceful out there if it wasn&rsquo;t that I wanted to get back to the hotel at a specific time I am not sure where I might have ended up.</p>
<p>That one run though helped start me on the path of getting out of my funk. In fact, it kind of reminded me that that is what helps me stay grounded. As I reflect back I was remembering the video I saw that I was going to post around the time of my Crash and was hoping to at a later point in time but completely forgot as I never really got out of that funk.</p>
<p>My example was getting me back to running and I will even say today I am finally feeling 100% back to normal running which is what I have been waiting to say for a long time. Everyone always has something to be down on, depressed about, or are just mopey about something. The challenge is trying to find something that works for you to get out of your current funk or mood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have never gone on a run or a bike ride or anything outside and thought back to myself I shouldn&rsquo;t have done that, that was really dumb to go on a run. Never! It&rsquo;s always a good thing. - Ryan Van Duzer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The video I have included below by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ryan Van Duzer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->@duzer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) is what I had watched right before my Crash! and there is some really good nuggets of insight and motivation that he offers while running in the hills of Colorado to get out of his own funk.</p>
<p>I can relate to his methods of remembering there is a whole lot of good things in life. Also, for me, one of the best ways for me to do that when things are stressful at work, home, or just something hard that I need to overcome, is that I just love getting out there to run. It clears my head and gives me a good start or end to the day.</p>

			 <p>Fall is definitely that time of year when things need to be cleaned up. You need to head out to the garage and start putting summer stuff away and bring out the winter stuff (wait not yet.. please not winter yet..). Honestly, though this is the perfect time of year to start decluttering. My wife and I did this last year and pretty much downsized our bedroom to 1 dresser (total) and a closet that is only 8x4. Needless to say, we got rid of a lot of stuff and it was the best thing to do.</p>
<h2 id="our-approach">Our Approach</h2>
<p>We honestly didn&rsquo;t have a specific approach in mind as well have just cleaned rooms from time to time over the 8 years we have lived here and as kids grew up and changed rooms we would then clean that room. More specifically, we would just move the junk to another room. So we finally realized that with 3 kids and all the stuff they have we obviously needed to make some changes and we felt that our room was the best one as it was a space we could control. So instead of doing lots of spaces or things at once we just focused all our efforts on that one room. It did help that once we got started we had the goal in mind of getting rid of one dresser in order to feel like we had more space in our bedroom and it didn&rsquo;t feel like everything was stacked on top of each other.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A year later and we have still been working on the other rooms of our house but it is something that takes time. Decluttering your house is not an easy feat unless you are just moving from college and haven&rsquo;t acquired anything. We got derailed this past year with the kitchen remodel but in a way that helped us declutter all of those rooms affected. The one thing if you move from room to room like my wife and I are doing you need to make sure you don&rsquo;t just go dump things back in a room you have already cleared out. However, that is one of the hardest things so when you get down to only a couple rooms left (like we are now) it gets harder and harder to get it to what you want. However, I am looking forward to the challenge this fall again as the seasons are changing.</p>
<p>If this is something that interest you and you have been wanting to get rid of a lot of stuff I would suggest that you check out what Anthony Ongaro is doing over at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Break The Twitch<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. In fact, the video below is a good way to get started with the 6 most Popular Methods.</p>

			 <p>I stumbled across this article over the weekend and it really resonated with me and I had to share. You should take the time to go read it and come back, but honestly, Seth Levine’s 5 points are really all you need to know.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I can sympathize with Seth and everyone else as I feel like a lot of us fall into this trap of always trying to take on more and more. Then eventually we hit a wall and have to assess our current situation in order to try to redirect our efforts. That happened to me about 9 months ago when work was getting busier and I was still involved in a lot of other volunteer projects and side projects. I think it finally hit me when I was at a couple of my son&rsquo;s basketball practices and realized I spent the whole time in the hallway on a conference call for a non-profit I volunteered for. During this same time, I was getting swamped with some side projects I was working on as well as since it was that time of year when lots of work needed to happen with them.</p>
<p>So I took a step back with all the information I had and told myself pretty much the five steps that Seth outlined above. I <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->NEEDED<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to slow down, I was doing extra things outside my day job that was cutting into my other relationships (i.e., Family and Friends). Ultimately, I knew nothing could change right at that moment as I had made commitments to the people counting on me for the side project work that was being done and the non-profit needed me till they found a replacement. I decided at that point I wanted to take the step of letting the non-profit know I had to move on. I don’t have anything bad to say about the non-profit and in fact, I really enjoyed all of my time working for them and still, today wish I was on the board. However, that was the first best step. As for the side projects, I decided to not take on or start anymore until Fall when I would reassess my current workload and family time.</p>
<p>Fast forward today, I think my redirection of my where I was spending time paid off. In fact, it made the summer more enjoyable as it was fewer things to worry about when we took our 17-day road trip. Also, as the school year just started it has allowed me to be more involved in my kid&rsquo;s activities by assist coaching.</p>
<p>As for my existing side projects, I am still trying to figure out if I need to cut back on them but for right now I think with the other smaller things I cut out of my schedule through the summer I should be in a good place come next February to push through the work on those projects and continue to support those that are counting on me.</p>

			 <p>Money has been on my mind for a post lately, in fact, you could say I think about it all the time. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(With my mind on my money and my money on my mind. - Snoop Dogg)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  So when the Blogging Meetup prompt of the day was “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Money<!-- raw HTML omitted -->”, I knew this was the sign I had been waiting for.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You can&rsquo;t blame me and I wouldn&rsquo;t blame you either if it was on your mind. In fact, it is probably one of the reasons why you wake up in the morning when you do and go-to-bed when you do as well. For me it is why I wake up when I do, ok not entirely as I wake up earlier to run, but if it wasn&rsquo;t my next thing to do at a similar time each day would I need the alarm?</p>
<p>My profession keeps my mind on money too as it is what we are known to help protect with safeguarded controls. Also, like most companies mine is no different where a part of year-end bonus are tied to financial performance and metrics (money).</p>
<p>Personally, I am sure I am like a lot of people that in their own way have certain struggles with money. It might be big challenges to overcome or could be something small but in the end, each person would probably say if only we had <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more!<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Then everything would work out and all would be right in the world.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so :) … I don&rsquo;t buy that response as I know I have said it before, so don&rsquo;t worry you are not alone.</p>
<p>Now I would love to say I have all of the answers and that here are the 5 things you can do to turn this around and never think about money again… but that isn&rsquo;t possible as I think no matter what situation you are in you still think about it to a degree but each person is looking at it from a different perspective.</p>
<p>The bigger question is probably <!-- raw HTML omitted -->what are people&rsquo;s relationship with money?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Now I know that sounds like a really big question and well it is. It is really what drives you to do what you do, or live like you do every day. Another way to think of it would be what is your end goal with the wealth you have accumulated or might accumulate? You could be one of the fortunate ones at the end of your journey and figure it all out but I am going to guess that is only a small number of people. I would take a guess that most people are on that road right now and it might not always be clear what direction you are going.</p>
<p>This is where my journey starts/started not long ago was that I realized I had not fully defined my relationship with money in my head. In fact, it was also that I didn&rsquo;t have any short-term goals attached to a larger one. I was just doing what the system told me when I left college. I got a good job and put money away for retirement.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So my question for you to think about is, what is YOUR relationship with money?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>That is all I have for today but let&rsquo;s keep this conversation going in the near future. I was kind of thinking once I started to write this might end up being a couple of posts in which I hope to build on them going forward and incorporate feedback from you.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->True Blue<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a short story by a favorite author of mine Eliot Peper (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->@EliotPeper<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) just released yesterday.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/51a6e1617b.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I will first say this is one of the first short stories I have read because most of the time I have strayed away from them in the past. However, I am glad I read this one as it was the perfect size for me to digest in my normally busy week.  Not to mention I am a fan of  Eliot&rsquo;s work and this is another one that doesn&rsquo;t disappoint and couldn&rsquo;t put it down. Let&rsquo;s just say it was good for me that it was a short story. The main topic of the book is around discrimination but is set in a more future state. Even though this book is a short story Elliot masterfully writes it in great detail with various twists you might not see coming.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/ffe3fd4fac.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>*I really can&rsquo;t say enough about the book and don&rsquo;t want to give too much of it away so go grab a copy as you can&rsquo;t beat the price as it only 2.99 (or free if you have Kindle Unlimited).  So go grab a copy today and start your weekend off right. *</p>

			 <p>I had a great post for you a couple of weeks back I was in a slump about running and getting motivated to get out and run every morning.  I was thinking now that I am back at it 100% and fully motivated it would be a great time to share but then this happened this morning:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That picture was taken well after the run, a painful shower, and three bandage changes later.  Though that wasn&rsquo;t it as I really twisted my ankle and have a couple bruised ribs (or that is what the doctor told me).  Also, my iPhone took a good fall on the pavement as I normally run with it and that was the arm that broke the rest of my fall.  Overall, nothing major was broken or damaged but I am a little slower moving today.</p>
<p>You might be wondering how this happened and I wish it was a much more glamorous story.  I was running along like normal on the sidewalk but on a rougher part of asphalt and my foot must have hit a dip wrong and my ankle twisted bad and there was no coming back from that.  I broke my fall with my hand for the most part that was under my chest.  I quickly rolled over into the grass and said some choice words to the sky as I knew my iPhone was on my arm that broke the fall.  I got up quickly as well and noticed a lady stopped in her vehicle asking if I was ok.  I said I was all good and started to jog off.  After two blocks and I knew I was dripping blood from my hand and knees I decided to stop and just walk the remainder of the way home as I also knew my ankle was tender but probably not broken.  On the walk home I realized I had a lot of pain in my chest as well which ultimately is probably bruised or cracked rib.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Sooo&hellip; stay tuned and I will still post it (probably Monday) as I might need some more motivation after I get all healed up.</p>

			 <p>For anyone who has read the book <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Born to Run<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or enjoys running, in general, needs to check out this series of videos that Ryan Van Duzer put together of his trek down to run the Caballo Blanco Ultra Marathon earlier this year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t feel pain if your smiling&hellip; right?&rdquo; - Ryan Van Duzer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was a perfect quote he had at the very beginning and was fitting since he was smiling during what appeared to be the last couple of miles at the end of the video.  Honestly, being a runner myself, after watching this video I was ready to strap on my shoes and hit the trails.</p>
<p>Take note, not only is the feat of running 50 miles in a single time amazing but remember he did it all while carrying the video camera to capture this amazing event on film too.  If you are looking to be motivated you should definitely check this video out.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here is the entire playlist so you can start from the beginning and watch all 6 episodes.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Finally, as amazing as these videos are, Ryan has made a bunch of other amazing videos and I don&rsquo;t see that stopping anytime soon so be sure Subscribe to his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->YouTube channel<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and follow him on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Instagram<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (you can also find him on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Facebook<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twitter<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>

			 <p>Another year has come and gone but not without leaving a great impact to end 35. This past year the continued theme for me was to lead a healthier life, which mostly involved me spending more time outside running, biking with the kids, and ultimately trying to stay more active on a week-to-week basis.</p>
<p>This past year my wife and I also made a big decision that she was going to take a year off from Teaching in a way to slow down our crazy hustle and bustle life. With three kids there is never really a slow moment but we thought this would help us not rush the kids out the door by 7 am with us yelling at them because they were moving slowly and tired. I will say it has been a great change for the family she has been home to get our oldest on and off the bus each day, taking our middle child to Pre-School and the being able to spend time with the youngest while the older ones are off to school. I am sure some of it depends on the day but overall she has been enjoying this change and it has allowed our family to not feel so rushed.</p>
<p>For me specifically in trying to slow down or reprioritize my efforts I have started to really evaluate where I spend my time outside of work and realized I need to start saying “NO” to certain projects/volunteering activities. While I can’t say I have really severed ties with anything yet it has been on my mind as 2017 started and I have put a plan in place to evaluate those various activities as I want to make sure I am getting the most out of my days and making sure I am spending it where I want to spend it (more on this in a future post). Also, I realized it is very important for me to reevaluate things like that as work has become more time-consuming and I still want to put my best effort forward and still find time for the other things but knowing it can’t be everything.</p>
<p>Finally, this past year was a great milestone as my wife and I celebrated our <!-- raw HTML omitted -->10th Wedding Anniversary<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. However, on a sad note last year we had to say goodbye to our 13-year-old Yorkshire Terrier <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tucker<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and our youngest child says she misses him each day.</p>
<p>Finally, as I look forward to what 36 will bring for me I am not entirely sure. One thing is for sure, though, I will continue to make tweaks to my routines, projects, and continue to work on cultivating/making time for the true friendships I have. One big thing that will happen in the upcoming year is that we are going to take a road trip from Minnesota to Maine in the late summer. It will be a two-week trip one on the road and one on the ocean. That trip could mark the beginning of yearly family road trips or the final one… time will tell :).</p>
<p>I have learned so much in the last year and I hope to continue that going forward.</p>

			 <p>The “<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->little<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->” side project that some of you may or may not know about call <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blogging Meetup<!-- raw HTML omitted --> just hit another major milestone today&hellip;  It has been one year since I wrote the first post on that site as well as my own (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Community - Blogging Meetup<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) that started it all out.  I took a couple minutes to thank everyone on the site which you can find the repost below with a link to the original here (Blogging Meetup - <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Congratulation on 1 year<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I actually can’t believe it… Today marks the day that The Blogging Meetup is now one year old. I couldn’t be more excited about how it has grown and brought people together from all around the world.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In fact, I wish I could personally thank each and every one of you (383 registered users as of today) for whatever amount of contribution you have made to the continued success of this site. Even if you aren’t posting or chatting it up in the Community Chat you might just be a passive reader of the blogs listed on the site and then make sites/connections through their site. It is because of all of you that WE are still here today, as I said from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->beginning <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and I will quote it here:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Well, enough about me and back to the community! One year, I am still really stoked about that accomplishment and I hope each and every one of you are as well. I know there is things we could do better or have great visions of for this community but it will come. The one thing I have learned over the last year is that it doesn’t all need to happen right away and maybe it will someday or maybe it won’t. Now with that said, if there is something you are hoping could change or you personally would even like to change about The Blogging Meetup let me know. Post it in the comments below, include me in a post of your own on this site, direct message me on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twitter <!-- raw HTML omitted -->or you can just email me at <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="mailto:hello@ericmwalk.blog">hello@ericmwalk.blog</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I can’t wait to see what plays out in this next year but trust me I am looking forward to posting something similar when we are 2 years old :). Again, I would love to hear what you have to say or think as I am committed to having this place around for as long as people want it. I paid for another year of the domain name and will continue to do so until the lights shut off.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->One final note of appreciation goes out to Amanda, as she took an early interest in this project and has helped to do a lot of the admin work for its continued success. It looks like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->we did do something right<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as it is still kicking along!<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>&ldquo;The Boys in the Boat: Nine Americans and Their Epic Quest for Gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics&rdquo; by Daniel James Brown is a book I honestly probably would have never read this book if it wasn&rsquo;t at the suggestion of my Grandma during Thanksgiving.  She had mentioned two books she thought everyone should read and this was one of them.  Most of the time I read fiction books of mystery and suspense.  However, this non-fiction book proved to be more of a page-turner than the last couple books I had read during the holidays.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h3 id="first-thoughts">First Thoughts</h3>
<p>As I first started to read this I was thinking to myself I know nothing about rowing and it is set in such an earlier time that I feared I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to relate.  However, I was wrong on both accounts.  The book definitely takes you back (as it was before my time), to a time in the great depression.</p>
<p>As for not knowing anything about rowing, after reading it for a couple of nights I felt like every time I went to bed I was dreaming about rowing.  Some of that was the way the author did a great job at talking about all parts of rowing but not necessarily at the same time.  It was over the course of the book he talks about the various terms and I started to understand what the coxswain, engine room, bowman, and stern.</p>
<p>The book is entirely from viewpoint of Joe Rantz, a poor farm boy from the state of Washington who was growing up during the great depression.  The book takes you through his struggles after he lost his mother early on and then was abandoned by his father.  You can tell through the story that all of the struggles he faced as a child gave him the discipline and strength to pursue rowing once he got to college as he had never done it before.</p>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>If you are looking for a good page turner I would definitely check this book out. If you have read it I would love to know why you thought.</p>
<p>Final thoughts, I know there was a PBS Documentary called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;The Boys' of 36&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that is based on the book that you can find on the PBS website.  I have not watched it yet but am going to check it out now that I have finished the book</p>

			 <p>I am flying back from a 3-day work trip, and thanks to the WordPress offline app I can write while at 10k feet.</p>
<p>One of the strange tricks my mind tells me is that when I am going to go on a work trip I will have more free time.  It tells me I will have time to explore the city, write, read more, watch a movie at the hotel or even work out more.  However, most of all that is a myth as what ends up happening is going to the office at my normal time but staying much later than normal.  Then that is normally followed up by going out to dinner with consultants or co-workers which always lasts much longer than anticipated.  Now I am not saying I don&rsquo;t have fun eating and chatting with others (much better than eating by myself) but it is things my mind always forgets happen when I am thinking/planning for an upcoming trip.</p>

<p>In the upcoming months, I will be traveling about once per month and I am hoping it will allow me to do more of the things that I have hoped to do when traveling.  Since I have found with most things so far this year, creating a habit or setting a goal would be a great start.  I will make sure to keep you posted on how it goes and hopeful can share any tips/tricks I might have found helpful.</p>

			 <p>For anyone that found the last post on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Electoral College<!-- raw HTML omitted --> interesting in any way, I felt that I needed to share this as a follow up as I stumbled across last Friday evening.  It appears there is more than meets the eye to the Electoral College as you will find out in the CGP Grey video below.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>via <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Re: The Trouble With The Electoral College – Cities, Metro Areas, Elections and The United States - CGPGrey.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>After watching the video it points out a couple more overall flaws that are part of our current system.  It is interesting to think that in the current system, in December the Electoral College could reverse the decision made by the &ldquo;Public&rdquo; (States Electoral Votes) a little over a week ago. I agree this would be bad to enact as it could cause a further divide in our country.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The current system benefits no citizen and protects no states</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of this is very interesting to point out as some of it I never knew before and honestly can&rsquo;t believe that we have a system in place today that allows it.  I do hope in the near future there are more discussions on what a modern election should look like.  I will be watching as all of this has really sparked my interest as well.</p>

			 <p>With everything else that has happened in the last couple of weeks, I managed to miss that the new &ldquo;Where the Heck is Matt&rdquo; video that launched.  I am a big supporter of the work Matt Harding does mostly because I think the overall concept of dancing in all different locations is awesome.  Even though it is only a brief couple of seconds he shows himself dancing at different locations it goes to show you how the world is not always as scary as everyone makes it out to be.  He sums it up nicely in the caption of this new video by saying &ldquo;We&rsquo;re stuck on this planet together and we need to take care of each other.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>I am not one to normally talk about politics nor do I want to bring up a large discussion of right or wrong regarding the outcome of who won.  I feel strongly that each person has a right to vote as well as vote for a candidate they feel strongly about.  However, after seeing the final results Wednesday morning, my very curious 7 1/2-year-old son had a lot of questions about the Electoral College.  Not to mention how could someone win overall without winning the popular vote.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now maybe everyone else is more versed in politics than me but I feel every election I try to remember why we use the Electoral College and what is a good way to explain when asked about it.  Yesterday, I was reminded of this great CP Grey video about the Electoral College and thought I would share it, as it really does a good job in showing why it was established as well as the potential flaws in using it today.  In fact, if you watch it till the end you will see why specific states were targeted on election night as they are every election.  Also, as a bonus, CP Grey updated parts where he gave percentages to give context after this election.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Do you feel the Electoral College is working as intended or should we just change to a popular vote where each vote is equal?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Ok after writing everything so far I have to put one political plug.  We can&rsquo;t change the results of the election and need to find a way to work together as a country.  The popular votes were still pretty close and that means a lot of us are not in agreement on some of the issues discussed during the election.  I hope in the upcoming months/year we work together as a society and address some of these key issues that seem to be bothering both sides. Finally, as the election cycle is now over I have seen lots of hate shared in my Facebook and Twitter feeds.  This is not going to help us unite as a country so I am going to try hard not to share those in an effort of not continuing to spread the hate.  I fully understand it is happening and I am not pretending it doesn&rsquo;t exist but because I want to be more focused on positives going forward as we do need to find a way to make peace so <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->#OnlyShareLove<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->(this idea was taken from my wife and you can find her little project about it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Education is something that is always on my mind as I grew up surrounded by it as well as attending school for about 16 years of my life. Fast forward to where I am today and I have three kids two of which are in the School system and a wife that is a teacher. The video below was very intriguing to me personally as I know there was a couple subjects that I wasn&rsquo;t great at back in school and still am not today <strong>(<em>cough</em> writing and spelling <em>cough</em>)</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would you choose to build a house on top of an unfinished foundation? Of course not. Why, then, do we rush students through education when they haven&rsquo;t always grasped the basics?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those areas that I was never really great at I just accepted it in realizing that that would not be my true calling. Especially since Math came easy for me I knew that would be my route going forward. However, Sal Khan has an interesting point that what if each year I would have had to continue to be at a certain level of writing and spelling until I mastered it. Would it have changed the outcome of my first career? I am going to guess it wouldn&rsquo;t as it never interested me much back then but if I was better in those areas it might change the overall trajectory of my life&hellip; Well, that is a good question and one I will never know.</p>
<p>However, I look at the education that my kids are receiving and I know it is really good but could it be better if they were challenged every step of the way or at least pushed to master the subjects they were being taught before they move to the next grade? It would take a great under haul of our current education system in order to get to the perfect place that Sal Khan describes, however maybe the education system we have today should take more steps to move us closer in that direction so we can at least narrow the gap.</p>
<p><strong>What are your thoughts? Do you think making people masters in all core subjects would be a good thing or a bad thing?</strong></p>

			 <p>Happy 10th Anniversary to by beautiful and lovely wife <!-- raw HTML omitted -->April<!-- raw HTML omitted -->!  It doesn&rsquo;t seem like that long ago when we first meet in college and well the rest seems to be history now.  However, to quickly recap here are some highlights:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/b22151ce00.jpg" alt="">
<em>10 years and counting</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Traveled Internationally to Peru, Belgium, Jamaica, Canada, and Mexico as well as traveling from coast to coast of the US (Arizona, Virginia, New York, California, Colorado, Texas, Michigan, Maine, Massachutes, New Mexico, Washington DC, Indiana, Washington, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, New Hampshire, Penslivania, Missouri)</li>
<li>Lived in two different states (Illinois, Minnesota) after growing up in Iowa our whole life.</li>
<li>Have had two amazing dogs (Tucker and PJ) that we spoiled completely until the kids took over</li>
<li>Have three amazing kids that are very unique in their own ways (Brecken, Madiana, and Gretchen)</li>
<li>Bought a house that was a real fixer upper that we have crafted slowly into a house we now call home</li>
</ul>
<p>Granted we have known each other for more than 10 years but even then in this short period of time being together we have done a lot together and now have a family of our own that keeps us very busy.  I would say we haven&rsquo;t change much at all but who am I kidding look at how my hair has changed over the years below as it is a lot grayer now! <em>(Can you tell what pictures were after kids :-) )</em></p>
<p>Thanks for a great 10 years as I couldn&rsquo;t imagine being on this journey in life with anyone else.  Also, I can&rsquo;t wait to reflect on the next 10, 20, 30 years and so on.</p>

<p>I am sure some of you have known this for a long time, that the reason most places have traffic jams/build ups are because of traffic inconsistencies.  However, C.G.P. Grey does a great job of explaining it in this video that I figured it was fitting to share prior to a Monday morning commute.</p>

			 <p>A little over a week ago we had to make the tough decision to put our dog down.  Not that we will ever know how much pain he was in but we could tell he was in pain and couldn&rsquo;t control his body as he once could.  In fact, over the last couple of months he never really came out of his kennel except for to eat, drink, and go outside when we forced him to.  Then in the final week before we made the decision he was throwing up almost every day and the accidents were happening more frequently.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My wife and I had had the conversation for probably the last couple of years but more seriously in the last couple of weeks before the day.  Tucker had been with us for 13 years, with a birthday coming up this October 24th, he was the first of our &ldquo;kids&rdquo;, and he has lived in multiple houses/states.  It was a really tough decision to make that I think looking back my wife and I didn&rsquo;t really realize how hard it would be in the week(s) after.  We believe our decision was right as we saw his health declining we didn&rsquo;t want him to suffer day to day as he had to walk up/down steps to get outside and selfishly we didn&rsquo;t want his last days to be ones where we would be angry that he was having accidents or throwing up all over.</p>
<p>As my wife and I talked about it in the weeks leading up to the day, we both wanted to be with him until the end and in our minds that was non-negotiable.  We did not want to just drop him off at a vet or humane society where his last moments would be filled scared, nervous, or anxious as he heard other dogs barking in the background.  We wanted him with us, with his sister PJ (who we have had for 11 years now), and his 3 human brother/sisters.  My wife ended up finding this local service that would come out and perform the procedure at our house.</p>
<p>On Tucker&rsquo;s final day I ended up waking up early to take him for a walk instead of my normal run by myself.  I knew it was going to be a long day of tears, sadness, and thoughts as we waited until the scheduled time late in the day.  I went to work as normal but ended up leaving work around noon and going home to take Tucker to the dog park one last time.  He used to love the dog park when he was younger and my wife and I would take him all the time.  You could see a little spark in his eyes while we were there but at the same time, you could tell he was frustrated that he couldn&rsquo;t do what the other dogs were doing.  He didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;run&rdquo; around but still enjoyed wandering around and checking out the things to jump on.  After the dog park, we went back home and I just laid on the couch with Tucker for probably 2 hours.  Honestly, I am not even sure the last time I just sat in one place for two hours and did nothing.  Then we ate dinner and I figured it was time to take him for another walk or his last walk with the whole family.  Once we got back from our walk all the kids sat with Tucker and were reading him books while he laid next to them.  Finally, around 7pm we got the knock on the door and knew it was time.</p>
<p>Tucker, you truly were an amazing dog and I will miss you dearly.  Thank you for all the times you were there for me and for making my life a little bit better/more exciting.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>All kinds of Scams are horrible let&rsquo;s just put that out there.  Because most of the time they use fear to take advantage of people in a weak moment.  The worst, in my opinion, are IRS scams because let&rsquo;s be honest no one really wants to mess  with the IRS or hear that the IRS is out for them.</p>
<p>Just yesterday I got an IRS scam call from the number (646) 981-0274 and the guy told me his name was &ldquo;Zach Parker&rdquo;.  He tried to do everything by the book of trying to strike fear into me paying them <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NOW!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  He told me I owed back taxes for trying to defraud the IRS, and started quoting the revenue codes that I was in violation of (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->which obviously no normal person would know<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).  They asked if I had a good tax attorney and then said the authorities were going to come arrest me and take me to jail for a minimum of 90 days as well as freeze all of my assets.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now stop!  I am guessing those comments alone probably scare most people into trying to work with these individuals in order to clear this up before heading off to jail in a squad car that evening.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Now if you are still on the line at this point because you are a little nervous, they will take it to the next level and tell you they will try to talk to their manager and see if they can get some approvals to get this sorted out today.  Once they come back on the line, they will tell you they have instructions for you but they need you on your cell phone as you are going to have to run to the bank to get money out (cash in fact) and then they will give you more instructions.  Also, they told me this is a conversation/topic that only both of us and his manager should know about.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wait am I in a James Bond movie, what Government Department is going to tell me to go get cash but keep my phone on me at all times.  Also, to not talk to anyone about this as it is a private matter. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Now if you ask about why the cash, they will give you an odd answer but it makes sense once you go out to the government website to report or look into types of scams.  They know people are on the look out of giving Credit Card information over the phone among other things.</p>
<p>So at this point, I obviously wasn&rsquo;t going to go to the bank as I was working and really needed to get some work done.  So I did the dreaded thing of hanging up as I walked out of my office to my next meeting.  Obviously, when I returned 30 min later I had missed 15 calls but the interesting thing it wasn&rsquo;t from the same number I originally got called from.  They actually took it a step farther&hellip;.. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->They <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->masked<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> my local police department <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->number.. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wait what! <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I want to make a point about that as that is really scary and sad because you know that would have also scared someone enough into doing what they say.  However, they didn&rsquo;t leave a message the only reason I knew this was because I did a reverse phone look up.  Let&rsquo;s be honest if the Police take the time to call a resident don&rsquo;t you think they would leave a number to call back at least?</p>
<p>I was kind of ticked at these scammers at this point going to these lengths to scam people that I decided to first call my local police department to let them know.  Also, I wanted to make sure that was part of the scam which was confirmed as the Officer said no one had called me or needed me for any reason.</p>
<p>Now at this point, I should have just stopped but was a little curious what would happen if I called back to the original number on a different number.  The first time, they answered but hung up when I asked what department of the IRS it was.  The second time they didn&rsquo;t answer and it just kept ringing.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Odd right?  Wouldn&rsquo;t you think the IRS would have a messaging service or voice mail or something?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I decided to call back from my original number and someone answered who knew me from the first time or at least my name must have come up.  I asked some questions like I didn&rsquo;t know what they were talking about from the first time but only because I wanted to hang up on them.  Then about 30 seconds later, I got the masked call again from my local Police department, no greeting or anything but saying they have been trying to get a hold of me for a half hour since a fax came over.  They wanted to know my address so they could send an officer to pick me up right away.  I asked for the person name and he said his name was Mary Ellis.  If you picked up on the fact I was addressing Mary as a he, it was because the person on the phone was trying to sound like a girl but was more than likely the exact same person I was just talking to.  In fact, I could hear the same background noise of people talking about Taxes where I am guessing &ldquo;Zach&rsquo;s&rdquo; friends were trying to scam someone else.  I told him, who was acting as the local authorities, it was interesting that they had been trying to get a hold of me for the past 30 min as I had just talked to my local authorities who knew nothing about needing me.  At that point, the person hung up, scam over.</p>
<p>During and after everything was done I obviously reported the number and any important information to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (TIGTA).  It sounds like these scams are increasing as of lately for an unknown reason but remember most of the &ldquo;scam&rdquo; points I was noting above are noted on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->IRS websites<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of things to look out for.  Here is another government site with a nice Infographic on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->IRS Imposter Scams<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Finally, I have included a good video below talking about IRS Imposter Scams.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Just be careful out there as the people on the other line try to make it sound legit.  I hope it doesn&rsquo;t and hasn&rsquo;t happened to any of you.  However, if it has leave a comment below as I would enjoy hearing how it went for you and if your experience was similar to my story.</p>

<p>It does sound so simple, doesn&rsquo;t it!  I really love that video clip and was reminded of it the other day when I was reading this great article online by Joshua Becker titled &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Foundation For Financial Freedom That 10 Out Of 10 Financial Advisors Agree On<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;.  The information in the article, as well as the short video above, is very spot on to people in today&rsquo;s world, in fact, my wife and I have struggled before on that very topic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spending less is such a difficult step for many to take is because the solution sounds unattractive. Buying less sounds a lot like taking a step backwards in life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lot of Podcasts/friends have been having guests on talking about Finances, getting out of debt, or just changing your spending habits in order to make sure you spend your money on the things that truly make you happy.</p>
<p>I have actually been focused on this topic and since my day job revolves around finance/accounting it is obviously something that I am interested in.  Even more so now that my wife and I have decided that she should take a year off so we can slow down and focus on family and give our kids more attention instead of having them spend their entire day away from our house at either school or daycare.  So with that, we are even more focused on our finances as we have shifted to a one income household.  I will make sure to continue to pull together interesting resources, articles, and podcasts that I have found to share with everyone. Remember there is never a one size fits all solution but the information can help give you thoughts on how you could make it work for yourself.</p>

			 <p>A little over a week ago I was not feeling like myself, in fact, my muscles were sore like I just ran a marathon and did 1000 push-ups at the same time.  I have never had that feeling before and it lasted for quite some time which was concerning.  I actually ended up going to the doctor after day two but all they told me was that it was probably some sort of virus.  <em>Gee thanks for the help doc.</em></p>
<p>I am happy to say as of this past Monday I was back to myself and feeling 100% again.  I have never had a sickness make my whole body feel like that before and I hope I don&rsquo;t have it again anytime soon.</p>
<p>Over the past weekend (and through this week), as I was starting to feel better slowly I was reflecting on how bad I felt last week and I realized that I was really bothered by feeling so out of it that whole week.  It wasn&rsquo;t that the doctors didn&rsquo;t give me any great advice or cure and it also wasn&rsquo;t that I was worried I wouldn&rsquo;t get better (well OK maybe at one point I was a little worried).</p>
<p><strong>What was really bothering me last week was that I never stepped foot outside in the early morning to run!</strong>  There were so many times during that week that all I wanted to do was wake up earlier, lace up my shoes, listen to a favorite Podcast or new audiobook, and hit the streets. However, I never did run at all that week as I knew resting my sore body and allowing it to fight whatever virus I had was the best solution.  Thinking back about it now I think the reason it really bothered me was that I had been running at a minimum of 2-3 times per week since January 1st and I was worried that if I didn’t get back out there I might lose the motivation/habit I have created thus far.</p>
<p><strong>It is truly amazing the power of habits (good or bad ones), that once you have formed a habit over a long period of time and stray from it, it can bother you to your core.</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I am happy to report, though, I didn&rsquo;t lose the motivation/habit as of this morning I hit my 3rd run of the week which is pretty normal for me as I try to run Monday, Wednesday, and Friday in the early mornings.  That schedule has helped me create this habit over time but now that it is more of a routine I am flexible in missing a morning/day as things come up as I know I will find the time to run another day.  Trying to mentally set a schedule or number of times in a given week was something I knew I needed in order to hold myself accountable of my 2016 goal of running.  Some other tips/tricks I have found this year to which have helped to reinforce my habit, especially at the beginning was to just get out there and do it.  As much or little as I could, in the beginning, it didn&rsquo;t matter as long as I was running during the week.  Another tip I have found is to just talk about it.  I know that sounds a little silly but by talking about running with others and on this blog actually helps energize me to run again and keep the motivation as I have this other strange feeling that I would be letting someone else down.</p>
<p><em><strong>How about you?  Have you done something so frequently that when you stopped or took a break from it you were scared you could never start up again?  Or have you found any tips or tricks to keep yourself motivated to do something that you want to stick to, I would love to hear about it in the comments below?</strong></em></p>

<p>Seeing how school has just started for my kids I was reminded of this video I ran across a couple years ago.  There is a lot of good points in the video to ponder about specifically how the education system is structured today and where/how we are currently emphasizing specific topics.  I agree with the presenter that there is a problem with how the education system is structured today and the priorities that they are instilling in our youth.  It is something that is easy to point fingers as I feel everyone has an opinion on how the education system should be structured and what should be taught.  That is where it starts to break down though as there is too many opinions on it.  Additionally, it is something that can&rsquo;t be fixed overnight and has a lot of moving parts to the overall educational system.  That isn&rsquo;t to say nothing should be done, I think one of the problems and solutions is to just realize that education isn&rsquo;t a one size fits all as each person learns differently, is more interested in specific topics and on top of that learn a different paces.</p>
<p><em><strong>I would love to hear what your thoughts are on Education and Creativity.  Do you feel we have an issue today or are we doing the best we can?</strong></em></p>
<p>Hope you enjoyed this presentation as much as I did, here are two of my favorite quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If you are not prepared to be wrong you will never come up with anything original&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We are educating people out of their creative capacities</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yesterday, charity: water published the video above as part of celebrating that the non-profit has been around for 10 years now helping to solve the water crisis for 10 years.  That is an amazing accomplishment and this video takes you back to the beginning of how Scott Harrison started the company.  In fact, it takes you a bit further back to how major dots in his life which probably and ultimately led him to create the company.  Hearing his story again is always so powerful and moving and never gets old.  The whole video itself is so powerful and moving and the message is very simple:</p>
<p><strong>Clean water changes everything.</strong></p>
<p>and the organization has a simple goal of ensuring:</p>
<p><strong>No one on earth will die from dirty water.</strong></p>
<p>###Why do I care about charity: water
I have been a big fan of this organization for a while now and one of the main things that drew me to it was how transparent they were by investing/figuring out ways to give donors confidence in what they are doing.  Some examples are showing a Google map of all the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Completed Projects<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by using GPS or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Building Remote Sensors<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in order to report on the water flowing at any of their projects, at any given time, anywhere in the world.  Not to mention, the 100% model, this was such a radical change back when charity: water was started as it was the first of it&rsquo;s kind to help promote confidence that a charity would not misuse the funds it has been given for project purposes by really requiring them to figure out another way to obtain funds for Administrative purposes (e.g., salaries, office space, computers).  That idea was so powerful of a change that I have now seen it starting up at other non-profit organizations.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to see what happens with this organization in helping solve the water crisis in the next 10 years.</p>

<p>“Ultimately [finding your tribe] comes down to reaching out to people. … It comes down to putting yourself out there to find the people that you resonate with.” - Jeff Sandquist</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The podcast, during that morning run, really made me reflect/challenge why my existing connections are still very important and reminded me that I still need to do a better job of staying connected to them.  Also, it hit me that even though my life/work tends to get away from me, I still need to continue to create/cultivate new(er) connections with people that I resonate with.</p>
<p>This idea of &ldquo;Finding your Tribe&rdquo; fits nicely in a year of changes as I continue to reflect on how I want my life to look in the next year/decades to come.  Even, more importantly, it is an underlying theme that guides who, what, and where I want to spend my <em><strong>free time</strong></em>.</p>
<p>There is a lot of other good resources that Jeff points you to with links on his page so I would suggest you go listen to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->podcast<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and check out the other links and information he has.  While you are at it, consider supporting this local (to me) Minnesota Podcaster by checking out his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pateron page<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

<p>Certain job, and career choices are fundamentally incompatible with being meaningful engaged on a daily basis with a young family. - Nigel Marsh</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seeing how I have a young family at home I can relate how each employees definition of what Work-Life balance should be and should look like can differ drastically. As I have only worked at a couple companies through out my career, I know each has had their own version of work-life balance and I would say each had good and bad parts to it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t design your life someone else WILL design it for you and you may not like their idea of balance. - Nigel Marsh</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, I work for a company that is fairly flexible in my opinion. I won&rsquo;t say everything is exactly how I would imagine my perfect day but they value family and that helps for where I am at in my life. I think for my personal situation it is trying to balance my own definition of how I want work/life to balance out on a daily, weekly, monthly basis given my situation, job, priorities. It is a constant balancing act between all of those points which is why there isn&rsquo;t a one size fits all solution and you just need to make the most of it.</p>
<p><em><strong>What is your definition of work-life balance?</strong></em></p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Neon Fever Dream<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Eliot Peper (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->@EliotPeper<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) was a really good page turner that once I finally started I couldn&rsquo;t put it down as I wanted to know what would happen next (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I probably should have read about one month ago but kept putting it off until Monday night<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).  This is another book of his that I can&rsquo;t recommend enough as I have tried to read every one of Eliot&rsquo;s books since he first published Uncommon Stock: Version 1.0 a couple years back.</p>
<p>In full disclosure, I was fortunate enough to receive an advance copy of the book a while back.  However, at this exact time, you can&rsquo;t read it yet but can Pre-Purchase it.  In fact, even though I received the advanced copy I still decided to purchase it as well.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The story starts out by getting you acquainted with the characters over the first couple of chapters to give you a good backdrop of the main character so you get a sense of her background.  Then everything is turned upside down in an instant with Asha and as a whim of trying to take control of her own life she ends up heading to Burning Man with her new best &ldquo;friend&rdquo;.</p>
<p>However, just when everything seemed to be getting on the right track, Asha realized she doesn&rsquo;t know the people she is with as well as she thought and she needs to quickly figure out who to trust and who is telling the truth.  Once sorted out is only the beginning as the bigger story of a criminal take down brings more twists and turns to the past of hers and the people she decided to trust.  Each page will make you question if she is trusting the right people from her current situation or her people from her past from long ago.  Will they still be able to take down the criminal empire?  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(Come on I can&rsquo;t tell you the whole story here, check it out yourself, trust me it is worth it.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Most of the story takes place at Burning Man, which I have never been to and not sure I ever will in my lifetime.  However, with Eliot&rsquo;s style of writing, I felt like I was there.  With my little understanding of the event and layout, I really did feel like I was walking or biking around the playa visiting the various places.  In fact, one specific part of the book detailed out the author&rsquo;s thoughts on the event that shows you the amount of detail he added:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One of my favorite quotes of the book that kept on popping up (four times I think) was:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Update:  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you are looking for some details on what inspired the author to write this book check out his post title <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A dark secret hides in the swirling dust and exultant revelry of Burning Man<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, where he talks about it.  I always think it is interesting to hear how/why an author wrote a particular book.</p>

			 <p>I was on a good streak for a while there, at least it was a good streak for me.  Then June came and went and it is almost halfway through July and I really haven&rsquo;t written much on my site at all.  That is not to say I haven&rsquo;t posted anything as I have made a point to post something every week for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wordless Wednesday<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I have actually found this task enjoyable as I search through all of our old photos (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->172,939 as of 07/20/2016<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) and find something I feel is interesting to share.  Then I try to remember/figure out where I exactly was when I took the picture.  I really should expand on my photo searching topic and write more about the full experience instead of a caption.  Lately, I just haven&rsquo;t found the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->time<!-- raw HTML omitted --> motivation to write much more than a caption so it fits perfectly into how I have adapted the Wordless Wednesday.</p>
<p>Spending all of this time searching through old pictures it does kind of allow me to procrastinate other tasks like actually writing something, reading, or finishing up some work (as the day job has been busy too).  I won&rsquo;t discredit the fact that I might be procrastinating a little bit I do feel that even though summer seems like a great time to reflect, think, and motivate yourself to write/blog I feel it does the opposite to me. It does give me time to reflect, think but it instead motivates me to do other but more family-focused as my wife and kids are out of school for the summer.  Then oddly enough I probably have more things to write about as I am thinking/doing more stuff in the summer, I have found the lack of time/motivation at the end of the day to sit in front of the blank white screen and just type.</p>
<p>Has anyone else found it harder to find the time or motivation to sit down and write during the summer months and if so why?  Or do you find that it is easier to write in the summer months and why?  Just wondering if I am the only one.</p>

			 <p>It has been a really crazy past couple of weeks probably month as I look back and I am still trying to digest all of what has happened.  To give a little background a couple of weekends ago my 4-year-old daughter had her very first dance recital on the same day we celebrated my son&rsquo;s 7th birthday with all of our family.  It is always good to have our family in town for these events as it always seems we never see each other enough and these events are a great way to force us getting together.</p>
<p>Then Sunday came and I found out that a college friend of mine had passed away from a brain aneurysm (he was 34).  He was at home visiting his family and had some headaches.  He finally went to the ER but at that point, it was too late.  Then later on Sunday, my wife&rsquo;s cousin and her husband had their third born who was a beautiful baby girl.  However, as we all knew prior to the birth the baby was going to be born with a hole in her heart and her time was going to be very limited to hours, days, or if lucky a couple of weeks.  So as expected but something we were all secretly hoping would not happen, the child passed away the following day.  I was glad that my wife was able to make it down to Iowa and visit her but honestly it was still hard to process that the parents only had less that 24 hours with their baby.  As a father of 3, it was hard to think of only having 24 hours with any of my three kids let alone even the 7, 4, or almost 2 years that I have had with each respectively.  To the parents credit, based on the pictures I saw of the child&rsquo;s 24 hours on earth, they made sure to use/spend each one of those hours to the fullest holding the child, giving it lots of love and attention knowing/not knowing when their time would be up.</p>
<p>The weekend of the funeral, my wife and I attended while our kids were hanging out with my parents.  Typically we don&rsquo;t shield death from our kids as it is something that happens and we they have lost a Grandparent (my wife&rsquo;s mother, my mother-in-law) in their short lifetime. In this case, it is something that they didn&rsquo;t need to see as it was hard enough for me as an adult to see such a small child less than a day old, no bigger than a doll, in a casket.</p>
<p>Tragic events like that really make me stop and think how short life is sometimes and you never know what is around the corner no matter how much you plan.</p>

			 <p>It has been more than three weeks since I have finished the book titled <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The More of Less: Finding the Life You Want Under Everything You Own<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Joshua Becker and honestly this was a book I really couldn&rsquo;t put down after I started it.</p>
<p>Before I tell you about the book specifically I want to point something out, I had originally started with only the Kindle version and was enjoying reading it at nights before bed but I realized that I only found limited time to pick it up every night as it didn&rsquo;t fit with my normal routine of reading/listening to things.  So I decided to upgrade my purchase to the audible companion which was well worth it as I could listen to the Audiobook during my morning run, or while cleaning up and getting things ready in the evening for the next day.  However, the biggest benefit was that I could then pick up my Kindle and actually physically read the book right where my audio portion left off.  Honestly, the best of both worlds and I would recommend it for this book as I can see myself reading and listening to it again in the near future.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Now onto my thoughts of &ldquo;The More of Less: Finding the Life You Want Under Everything you Own&rdquo; by Joshua Becker.  For someone like me that has just stumbled upon this concept of minimalism, I still really hadn&rsquo;t figure out what it meant and assumed that this book was going to tell me how to throw away almost everything I own.  I quickly realized by Joshua&rsquo;s definition of minimalism it didn&rsquo;t specifically talk about &ldquo;physical things&rdquo; and in fact, I feel this is a much better definition than what people think.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Minimalism: the intentional promotion of the things we most value and the removal of anything that distracts us from them</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After reading that definition in the book it dawned on me as to why he titled the book &ldquo;The More of Less.&rdquo;  Through the book, he explains this from his own personal story of why he wanted less as well as through the stories of others which are great examples of how The More of Less can take on many forms.  In fact, you quickly realize there isn&rsquo;t a wrong answer or a right way, you just need to figure out your own <strong>WHY</strong>.  It is a tough question that takes some time to figure out and I honestly believe it might change as you go.  It has for me at least.  Once you start formulating it in your head, it should become clearer as to the actions you might want to take in order to get you on the right track.  That track is again where this book is great. Joshua does a great job laying out various examples of what you can do to take those next steps after the why.  In fact, most are simple steps to get you started, and nothing life-changing like selling/getting rid of everything you own.  Now I had started some of this process of removing less value-added things in my life (I call it decluttering) before I read the book but one of his super simple ideas to start was to keep your car clean.  Why that is so simple that it hadn&rsquo;t even been on my mind yet and with 3 kids your car quickly becomes overtaken with &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; all over.  So that night after reading that part of the book I cleaned both our vehicles out.  Now after 3 weeks it is still cleaner than before because it is easier than before and every time I get into my car I just feel that much better.</p>
<p>That was just one example of the many that are touched on in the book.  Honestly, when I got to the last page I was just finishing an early morning run and I was a little sad that the book was over.  There is so many useful examples/thoughts that Joshua put in there and I enjoyed hearing all of them as they continued to shape my thoughts.</p>
<p>I would definitely recommend this book to everyone as I think everyone can find pieces/parts of the book that will relate to their lives no matter what your own personal situation is.  Joshua Becker has also written some other books, has a blog where he captures his thoughts as well at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Becoming Minimalist<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and also has a 12-week course titled <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Uncluttered<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>I really can&rsquo;t say enough great things about Kirby Ferguson&rsquo;s work as I have written about it before (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Everything is a Remix<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Everything is a Remix Remastered and Kickstarter<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). However, he put together a new remix video around how Star Wars The Force Awakens is just one remix after another.  As always Kirby does an excellent job researching the topic and then putting the story/details altogether.  If you enjoyed his other videos this one will not disappoint either.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now if you are like me and enjoy Kirby&rsquo;s work you might like to know that he is trying to produce more of these mini &ldquo;Everything is Remix&rdquo; videos but he needs your help.  So he has created another <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kickstarter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> project to hopefully help raise some more funds to tackle projects like these through the rest of the year instead of creating projects for other organizations.  He has already met the Kickstarter goal of $5000, which is great news because people can snag a really cool shirt and help support the project.  However, with 22 days to go, the hope is that should allow enough time to try to help him reach at least the first stretch goal of $20k so he will have the funds necessary to produce another addition to the Everything is a Remix series.</p>
<p>Obviously, I would encourage everyone and anyone that found the original series interesting to back this current project or more specifically check out his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Patron<!-- raw HTML omitted --> site to fund more of his work ongoing.  I have been following him for quite a few years now, I mentioned before and am definitely going to throw some more support his way.</p>

			 <p>A &ldquo;little&rdquo; side project that some of you know about, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blogging Meetup<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (formerly Bloggers Meetup), got some great news when it was featured on Wordpress&rsquo;s own Daily Post article talking about &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stay Supported with a Blogging Group<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;.  That was very exciting news for me and my co-founder <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Amanda<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the project.  For what started out based on some comments in a Blogging 101 course back on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->February 19, 2016<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, is starting to really grow, grow, grow.</p>
<p>It is always a great feeling to know that something you have created is actually working, bringing people together, and having people find the end result useful.  In the same time, I hope <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->every member<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the Blogging Meetup is just as excited as we are as it couldn&rsquo;t have been done by ourselves.  It is every one that participates, encourages, supports each other, and talks to others about the Community.  Honestly, it would not/could not exist without all of the members doing those things or keeping conversations going.  Even if you aren&rsquo;t someone that participates in an active discussion on the site, I am guessing/hoping every now and then you have used the Index to find a new blog or clicked on someone&rsquo;s Blog liked on the chat page.  Participation doesn&rsquo;t need to be always commenting on the site as discovering other blogs is a big part of the whole experience.  That is where the Community effect comes into play and that is why I feel like we are doing something right.</p>
<p>So I want to give a big <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CONGRATULATIONS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and virtual <!-- raw HTML omitted -->HIGH FIVE<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to everyone that has been, is currently, or in the future is planning on being involved in the Blogging Meetup Community.  This is still only the beginning as we continue to grow and try to figure out what works, what doesn&rsquo;t, and the bigger question of what&rsquo;s next.</p>
<p>One final note, I think there is a huge opportunity in the near future for the community to help support people taking the On-Demand Blogging U Courses.  We have bloggers of all different types/skills in our community and as I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wrote this morning<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the Blogging Meetup, a big factor I joined those courses was for the Community.</p>

			 <p>Seeing how it is getting close to that time of year again for College Graduations, it reminded me of this video I saw a while back where <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chris Sacca<!-- raw HTML omitted --> gave an awesome Commencement speech to the Carlson School of Management back in 2011.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What’s success anyway? Is success about making the most money? No, money for the most part turns people into jerks.&rdquo; - Chris Sacca</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is so many good words of wisdom in the video that I wish I could have heard that exact advice when I was leaving school.  However, fast forward to today and I think the advice is still valid and the points that he is talking about are applicable no matter where you are in your life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It all comes down to Happiness.  Happy people get jobs, happy people create, happy people win, happy people fall in love and raise family&rsquo;s, they lead and change the world. Happy people get what they want because often happy people realize they don&rsquo;t actually need much more than what they have and appreciate what they got.  Happy people are contagious.&rdquo; - Chris Sacca</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would really suggest you watch the whole video as there are a lot of good quotes and thought-provoking topics he touches on.  Four of the points stuck out to me as they are still so applicable today with everything happening in the world and how technology is continuing to change the way we do things and interact with people.  In the simplest form his words of advice and ultimately a way to be successful is <em><strong>Be Present, Be Helpful, Be Ethical and Be your Weird Self</strong></em>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Another one of my favorite quotes from the video was that around GPA as I also share the same view-point as him.  Hope you enjoyed the video.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Your GPA only matters to people who have no other reason to find you interesting.&rdquo; - Chris Sacca</p>

			 <p>Lately, I have not been finding the time to write much on here or even remember to post something that I have found interesting.  However, that is not to say I haven&rsquo;t started a bunch of different posts from time to time (this is one of those).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Today after looking back and removing a couple I still have 24 different draft posts waiting for me to either look at again and finish my thoughts or probably just delete them because I don&rsquo;t know what my original intent was.  Since most of the time, my blog is just about random thoughts and things that I find interesting it is easy to quickly capture it in a blog post for a later point in time with the &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Press This<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; bookmarklet.  Also, if I have an interesting thought I want to share I can jot down a couple of notes and then pick it back up when I find time.  Since the theme of my blog is less of a daily journal and more of a place I keep interesting things and thoughts, I never feel the need to have a specific real-time event to post or something that happened to me recently.  Particularly, because most of what I do on a day-to-day basis probably isn&rsquo;t the most exciting and it would kind of get repetitive though I know there are moments in each day I will cherish.</p>
<p>With so many Drafts started you might be wondering why I don&rsquo;t find time to push the publish button more often and I think the reason is frequency.  A lot of times, a week will go by when I have lots of thoughts and interesting things I find and then there will be weeks I don&rsquo;t have as much to say or share at all.  My problem is the times that I have a lot of things I don&rsquo;t want to overload my blog with 10 posts in a week as I know the next week I might not have anything.  My intention is then always to posting some of what I found the next week or sometime after that, but it never really happens.  Hence, it would be smart of me to schedule some posts to automatically be posted out in the upcoming week(s).  One of the reasons I am hesitant to do that is that I keep thinking I might find something more timely relevant that I want to share and don&rsquo;t want to post too frequently.  Another reason is that I really like to hit that publish button even though it gives me multiple chances to review and re-review that probably take away more time than necessary to get my thoughts published.  I am still trying to work on a sustainable habit of writing/posting.  I am trying to find a groove that works but sometimes I feel like I have thought block and can&rsquo;t think of much to say or don&rsquo;t really want to share anything I have already.  I have thought the scheduled posting route might be worthwhile but haven&rsquo;t taken the plunge on it yet.</p>
<p>If you have made it this far thanks for listening to my random thoughts and of course I have a question for you.  <strong>I am curious to find out how other people manage their blogs in terms of scheduling, frequency, and/or surplus of drafts?</strong>   Also, for bonus points do you have a goal in mind as to how many posts you try to write/share in a given day/week/month?</p>

			 <p>I stumbled across these videos a while back and forgot to share them as they are really amazing, especially if you enjoy skiing.  In fact, the videos don&rsquo;t seem really fitting anymore since all of the snow was gone long ago in Minnesota.</p>
<p>However, my Brother&rsquo;s family and my parents are out in Colorado this week skiing and while talking with them last night it reminded me that I had these videos in a draft post from a while back.  Watching these videos really makes me want to hit the slopes as it reminds me and makes me miss the time I used to spend skiing with my family in Colorado and Utah. It seemed like for a while there we used to go every year over Christmas break as a kid.  Not only did those trips create my love for skiing but thinking back it was a time that we got away from our normal day-to-day school (or work for my parents) with the only care (or care I had) was being the first and last person on the slopes every day.  Then at nights we just relaxed by a fire, played board games or watched TV.</p>
<p>I am always reminded of that tradition whenever I see pictures of mountains or other people skiing.  It is just amazing how those triggers bring me back to even my first time skiing in Colorado when I was in 5th grade.  Now that I am thinking back to then, I will see if I can dig up some old pictures to share another time, but until then enjoy these really awesome videos.</p>

<p>Finally, if you made it this far, is there a place you used to go as a child with your family that when watching a video, looking at someone else&rsquo;s pictures, or even just talking about something remind you of that time?  I would love to hear about the place and what seems to trigger that memory the most.</p>

			 <p>It was one of those perfect nights outside earlier this week when the moon was really bright making it super easy to go on a longer run when my first thought was to keep it short as I had some work to get done.  However, the glow from the moon and the warm weather was just too perfect to pass on the opportunity to complete my Virtual 5k for the upcoming #Run3rd 5k event I signed up for.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now you are probably asking, as I was 2 years ago, what the heck is a virtual running race and what difference is it than just going out on a run and completing a 5k?  Honestly, there isn&rsquo;t much difference unless you want to feel that extra push to complete a 5k and make it act like a race.  The thing that really appealed to me about this specific race was the already strong presence of a community around this #Run3rd theme.  The concept has been out there for a while so with that drove a good turnout in year one as people wanted to be a part of the Virtual race and as they finished they would share their experiences on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Facebook <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twitter<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  The other positive of just a virtual race in general for me is that I didn&rsquo;t have to travel anywhere and didn&rsquo;t have to give up my weekend as a normal race would probably last all morning with events and registration.  The actual race they have is on Saturday, April 2nd in Mesa, Arizona and it seems like as of today you can still register for the actual event or virtual one (<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.run3rd5k.com/">http://www.run3rd5k.com/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<p>Now you might be wondering what this #Run3rd movement/community is and instead of having me try to explain it I would suggest you go read about it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and/or watch the video below, which is really the mission statement and tells a good story.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I run 1st for myself, I run 2nd for my family, I #Run3rd for you.&rdquo; - Sean Astin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The thing that drew me in was that I felt like where I am in my life today I align with the mission statement of #Run3rd.  I just had never thought of it that way but it does put some things into perspective.</p>
<p><em>PS - One cool benefit even doing the Virtual #Run3rd 5k, if you are on the fence about it, is that you still get a finisher medal as well as a cool t-shirt.</em></p>
<p><em>Edit: Here is the cool shirt and medal I got for the 2016 run and I can&rsquo;t wait till next year!</em></p>

			 <p>My thirty-fifth birthday has finally come after what has been a unique year, to say the least.  I am actually not one to really talk about my birthday so this is kind of a rare post as I am actually admitting to when it is.  Part of my reason for doing it this year is I feel like going forward it would be a good place to reflect on the year instead of marking my year on Jan 1st when most others would.  So without further ado&hellip;</p>
<p>This past year, I found myself traveling to Germany for the second time in my life and China for the first for work.  Traveling to me is something I enjoy but with a young family, all kids under the age of 6, it makes it harder to be away from home often.  On top of traveling internationally, my wife and I attended a wedding in Seattle without kids and spent a couple of days before touring around.  It was a great way to break up the normal flow of life with little kids.  I wish I could say we came back more refreshed than ever but with the wedding festivities and just touring around, we might have been more exhausted after our trip.</p>
<p>Being in a new job for most of the year and traveling more than prior years made the year seem really busy and go by fast.  Not to mention, in my free time over the summer months I was trying to build a deck, which in the end fast forward to this year, it has already paid for itself by the amount of time our kids have spent playing on it.</p>
<p>The year, of course, had ups and downs like anyone would expect.  It is a bummer how certain personal things played out throughout the year but honestly looking back now I think it was probably for the best.  True friends are still true friends even when you don&rsquo;t see them.  Also, it can&rsquo;t be always a one-way street because people have different lives sometimes, kids vs no kids, traveling job vs not traveling, owning a house in the suburbs vs living in a downtown apartment.  It bothered me for a long time as a friend of mine couldn&rsquo;t understand the situation I was in but honestly, I probably didn&rsquo;t always understand his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(I will post more on this another time)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  That probably consumed more of my energy/life over the past couple of years than I am willing to admit.</p>
<p>In January, I decided to make a commitment as I was approaching 35 that I needed to start living healthier but more specifically I wanted to start getting in shape to get into better <!-- raw HTML omitted -->habits<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and feel better all around.  With almost 3 months of these changes, I know personally and physically I am in a better place today than a year ago today.  I could probably expand that to the last 10 years.  In fact, I have lost weight, not that I am a heavy individual, but it was a weight that I probably should have never put on but has been holding constant for the last 5-6+ years.  I am hoping by continuing I will lose more and get back to the number I remembered but if not I am feeling really good about where I am today with the age I am today.</p>
<p>Looking forward, I really don’t know what’s around the corner for this year but I do know I currently like the direction I have ended my 34&rsquo;s.  It will not be easy,  there never is a year that is but I am looking forward to the challenges it will bring.  I will continue to make tweaks to my routines, projects, and friendships.  In the end, I know I am very blessed with what I have today, a loving wife, 3 amazing kids, a job that keeps me busy (and pays the bills), and some fun projects that I get to work on and meet amazing people.</p>

			 <p>I was telling my wife last night about how running at night sometimes plays tricks with your mind.  Most of the time it is when someone suddenly comes up out of nowhere and is walking/running at you, behind you, or just someone in the shadows of their house porch coughs or starts talking to someone on the phone.</p>

<p>It is funny if you ask me what bliss is it would all depend on the day, time, and what I was thinking about at that moment.  In fact, it would also probably depend on what I was doing the hours leading up to the question.  The thing is there are different things in my life that are blissful.  On the one hand, like the picture above it is a breathtaking picture of some secluded place or a picture from the top of a <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/02/12/quote-of-the.html">mountain</a>, or seeing one of the <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2015/12/03/now-you-can.html">7 wonders of the world</a>, or just a picture of my family having fun enjoying the little things in life as well as the company of one another.</p>

			 <p>Now in the second week of March (playing catch up), I thought I would give a quick list of some Podcasts (and favorite episodes) that have been keeping me company while running in the evenings.  My favorite part about all of them is that you can subscribe to them in iTunes, which makes it super easy to pull the next one up when you are heading out on a run or long car trip.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This Week in Startups<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Jason Calacanis (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->@jason<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) - The show is done twice per week where the host Jason has various entrepreneurs on talking about their companies, what they do, and how it could change the world.  Also, every couple of weeks there is a news roundtable where he has two guests on that talk about some of the big tech topics out there.  In January, one of my favorite shows to listen to was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->E614 where Jason was talking to the CEO Emily Kirsch<!-- raw HTML omitted --> who Co-Founded <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PowerHouse<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  The conversation was very interesting as it touched on what some new companies are doing along the lines of Solar and how Solar is becoming cheaper and one of the major roadblocks they run into is Policy.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Tim Ferris Show<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Tim Ferriss (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->@tferriss<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) - This is a great podcast and Tim has some really great guests like Edward Norton, Chris Sacca, Shaun White, Naval Ravikant, and Seth Godin.  Note all of those were just in the month of January and February.  Each of those people was probably my favorite episode of the last two months and I won&rsquo;t dive into it too much as I wrote a little bit about Naval Ravikant&rsquo;s interview in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->prior post<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Intentionally Wandering<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Jeff Sandquist (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->@jeff_wandering<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) - This one was created by a local Minnesota guy named Jeff Sandquist.  I really like how the podcasts are normally only 20-30 min which is perfect to listen to the whole thing in one sitting (or run as I prefer).  The other neat thing about this podcast is that it revolves around this same theme of Intentionally Wandering and, in my opinion, sharpening your own focus on how you view your world and the world around you.  He brings in some very interesting guests as who also do a great job of making you think and sharing their experiences.  In fact, I really like how he ends the episodes with guests the same way by asking them the same question that I always try to answer myself after each one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What is your why?  Why do you do what you do?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I should probably start writing my own answer down to see how much it changes over time.  Another nice thing, since I am normally out running when listening to podcasts, is how Jeff puts show notes on the websites about the episodes with links to find the other materials (books/articles) that were mentioned in the show.  One of my favorite recent episodes is a solo episode he did titled &quot; Lessons Learned from Being Curious<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot; and there was a quote in there that really stuck out to me as I can see myself in this quote sometimes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We are all born curious, but not all of us remain curious. Curiosity, while it does come naturally to all of us, it can easily be suppressed, lost and destroyed, depending on our environment, our upbringing, our experiences, and even our thoughts and our reactions and emotions towards this idea of curiosity.” - Jeff Sandquist</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what are you waiting for go check out some of these podcasts today!  Also, do you have any that you listen to frequently?  Let me know in the comments.</p>

			 <p>As I have been in what seems like a day full of meetings today, of which most were conference calls, I was reminded of these two great videos by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Trip and Tyler<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that I stumbled upon a while back.  If you have ever been on video calls or just normal conference calls I am sure they will resonate with you too.</p>
<p>The newer of the two videos, &ldquo;A Video Conference Call in Real Life&rdquo; is spot on to all of the issues I have encountered in the various video conference calls I have had.</p>

<p>Here it was 9:30 pm at night and I was just going to quickly finish writing a blog post I had started a couple of days back, but I was stuck and it felt like it was taking me too long to write.  It wasn&rsquo;t just flowing out like some of the ones last week did.  Then I realized that it is getting pretty late and I <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->really<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong> wanted to get a run in tonight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>So&hellip;. I went for a run.</strong></p>
<p>During my run, I reflected on how I have been having so much momentum with this blog and I should have just finished that blog post since I haven&rsquo;t made a post since last Friday.  Once I completed my run, feeling refreshed and motivated, I was reminded of a quote about why running appealed to Bernd Heinrich who was being interviewed in a video series titled &ldquo;Why We Run&rdquo; (video is at the end of this post).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It appealed to me because I could do it all the time where every I was, no matter where I could always run. - Bernd Heinrich</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This year as I have refound my love for running I have tried to embrace a quote like that.  I have been running on some cold days and very dark nights.  However, for me, it is time well spent and the motivation I feel from going for a run is just too good to pass up.  Now I know I didn&rsquo;t publish the actual blog post I was working on but I was stuck and needed to <strong>run</strong> away for a while.  In fact, as a result, of my run, I realized it helped motivate me to write/share something instead of having it feel forced.</p>
<p><strong>Now for a question, when you get writers' block, or writing seems slow, doesn&rsquo;t flow, or feels forced how do you get through it or refocus?</strong>  Leave me your thoughts or tips in the comments as I would love to know how you refocus.</p>

			 <p><strong>Can someone have too many hobbies or side projects?</strong></p>
<p>That is the question I have been pondering over the whole month of February.  Also, yes I know it is ironic since this is the same month I took a Blogging 101 course as well as having this crazy idea of creating a site called the Bloggers Meetup.</p>
<p>I look back at the month and I have still continued to do things that I have wanted to do, like running, reading (or listening to book tapes), keeping up-to-date with some podcasts, and trying to spend more time with my family on the weekends instead of being buried in work or side projects.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However, I do sometimes wonder if I have taken on too much.  It is unfortunately in my nature to keep volunteering at events, helping non-profits, starting side projects, or just trying new hobbies.  I am thankful that most of the things I do have different cycles of when they are busy and when they aren&rsquo;t so it normally doesn&rsquo;t create too big of a conflict.  However, then there are the times when my hobbies start to become more of a burden and it overlaps with other projects/hobbies or just my family time and that is when it really makes me think.</p>
<p>I really starting thinking about this a couple of weeks back and even though I love all of the projects I have been doing/created, I believe I would like to take the next step and get more focused on a couple of them.  It is not that I couldn&rsquo;t continue what I am doing today but at some point when the next side project comes along that seems interesting I won&rsquo;t have any resources to devote to it.  Or I will not be as devoted to another project and at that time, it might be one I would like to be devoted to.</p>
<p>So this year in my year of changes, I am going to try to make sure I keep tweaking my focus on things.  That is not to say I will drop everything tomorrow or even next month or within the next year.  I am going to start by looking at what projects/hobbies I carried forward from 2015 and make a list of why I am doing each and what I hope to continue to gain by doing them.  Some are very obvious to me right now but others are not.  As I am not sure what my longer term vision of doing it is.</p>
<p><strong>How about you?  Do you have any hobbies or side projects that you have been doing for a while that you need to take a closer look at the why?</strong>  I would love to hear your thoughts.</p>

			 <p>I have been in a couple Blogging 101 courses over the last couple of years and I have enjoyed them as they push me to continue writing and more importantly, I always stumble upon a couple great sites that I frequent well after the course is done.  One of the things I always enjoyed about the course is the sense of Community.  You had people of all different blogging/WordPress expertise working together and helping each other out along the way.  I was in a course a little over a year ago and was thinking wouldn&rsquo;t it be great to continue the conversation after the course was done?</p>
<p>Now I know you could still visit people&rsquo;s sites and make comments and suggestions.  However, by only doing that you never get a chance to ask questions?  You could end your post with a question but what if your question was about WordPress specifically, or a Theme, or just anything else that is random but doesn&rsquo;t really fit as a blog post on your site for people to respond to?  Also, that is assuming you have a magnitude of followers that actually see that post on a given week/day.</p>
<p>As I was in February 2016 Blogging 101 course, it was on my mind again about how could we do this.  I have seen it done before but most of the time they wall it off with a Private Site and then it makes it hard for people to even find it or know what it is about unless you stumbled upon it by someone else&rsquo;s post.  Also, there were blogs I started to follow that continued my thinking about this little project.  One specifically by Amanda titled &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->It Matters<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;, which it really resonated with me and I suggest you read it as well now.  Ok, now that you are back.</p>
<p>Insert, the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bloggers Meetup<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, where what finally pushed me into starting this was based on a simple post I read in the Blogging 101 course where a couple of people were asking what will happen next after the course is over.  I saw it as a time to recruit these people who had the same interest as myself in creating an Open Community where Bloggers could come and go and just chat with other bloggers.  You can read more about my initial thoughts on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bloggers Meetup<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as I don&rsquo;t want to republish the whole thing here (also this is getting long right?).  However, I would encourage any of you to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->register<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the site and then I hope to see you chatting with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Community<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Also, since it is just starting up feel free to throughout your ideas of how to grow or what you would like to see it become.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to thank everyone so far for registering and showing interest in this Community project.  Not to mention some of the first people who reached out to me like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@Amanda<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@AmeenasMusings<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, who have really helped get things off the ground there.  I can&rsquo;t wait to see what is next for all of us!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I finally got around to catching up on some blogs and podcasts that I listen to late last week and I realized that two of them seemed to be touching on the same topic, &ldquo;<em><strong>Habits</strong></em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Now each of them talks about it from different angles but both have made me reflect on the habits I have been trying to break this year.  Or even more specifically some of the good ones I am trying to create this year.  Some people might say well that really sounds like a New Years' resolution, but for me, it is more of a time commitment change in focus that will be ongoing.</p>
<p>This brings me to the first blog that has been actually talking about it all year.  The site is called Break the Twitch and it&rsquo;s creator <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anthony Ongaro<!-- raw HTML omitted --> does a great job of framing this up in his post a while back called &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->How I Created Daily Action Steps to Achieve My 2016 Vision (And You Can Too)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;.  There is actually a lot of good stuff in there about helping you create a vision for 2016 and follow through with it.  However, based on how I have been changing my habits this year the following quote resonated with me best.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To eliminate a bad habit, we first need to establish a good habit to take its place. - Anthony Ongaro</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then as I was running last outside last week and listening to The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tim Ferriss<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Episode titled <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Naval Ravikant on Happiness Hacks and the 5 Chimps Theory<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I would definitely suggest you listen to it as there are lots of good nuggets of information in that podcast.  For me, the reason it really stuck out again was this talk of habits and breaking habits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Learning how to break habits is an important/great meta skill. - Naval Ravikant</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He talked about the power of habits and that after you have broken a habit it helps teach you that all habits can be broken.  In fact, he said he break habits and creates new ones frequently.  One tip he had to break habits is a daily workout as he suggests it is very important to do some kind of physical activity at the same time every day no exception.</p>
<p>He suggests further that it happens in the morning as it will lead to better choices as you have to make sure you get to bed earlier.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree with him more on the psychology of physical activity and having it be in the morning.  For me, I have been adding a new habit this year of running but not in the morning as he suggests but at night.  This isn&rsquo;t the most ideal, and it does lead to some of the same things he mentions as leading to better habits all around.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>How about you, is there any new habits you are hoping to create in 2016 and in the process remove some bad ones?  I would love to hear about your success so far or what is holding you back in the comments below.</p>

			 <p>As I was reading my email last night everything became clear just as Jason Calacanis laid out in his post the day before titled &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Knowing when, and how, to pivot (or, why didn’t news apps work?)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;.  It is a really good article and I would suggest checking it out.</p>
<p>Like many people, I have a couple different news apps on my phone, maybe you don&rsquo;t and, in that case, lucky you.  Why so many you ask?  I use them strong for a couple of months and then I stop using them on a daily basis as I go back to where I always go to look for things social Media.  Yes, just as the article said, &ldquo;News apps failed because social networks succeeded&rdquo;, which couldn&rsquo;t be truer.  I check Twitter first to see what is going on and read/consume most of my news/articles there.  However, it is not to say I am not open to finding a better way to consume news because as I mentioned I have a couple of news apps on my phone but that is where they are, on my phone and I don&rsquo;t do everything on my phone.  However&hellip; My email is with me on my phone, tablet, and laptop and it is that running to-do list of things that are waiting for me to look at anytime/anywhere.  Now maybe my habit of email has gone down over the years, as I don&rsquo;t check it every 5 min, but I would say it still ranks pretty high on the usage ratio.</p>
<p>That is where these Newsletters are killing it these days because you are already in your email and you don&rsquo;t have to open yet another app.  Here are the top four newsletters I get every day that I always seem to keep opening:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Final side note on News apps, I installed NextDraft app on my phone but never really use it because the email is so perfect for my routine as it is in a place I already look and can access it anywhere.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on News Apps and do you think one will really stick around?  If you are a frequent user of one let me know what your favorite one is as I am always game to try new apps.</p>

			 <p>I am not one of those people to ask others for things. Specifically, in my career I am good at what I do but when I want to make a role change or find out about an opportunity from someone I end up dragging my feet and most of the time miss out on the opportunity. I tried to do better over the past couple of years but still it is something I am uncomfortable confronting people about. However, for those times that I have stuck my neck on the line it has been worth it even if it didn&rsquo;t end as I would ultimately hope but, at least, I didn&rsquo;t have to think I just missed out.</p>
<p>Today I was again reminded that it never hurts to ask. I have thought about my career path at the company I am working at lately. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong what I am doing now is fine and I don&rsquo;t mind doing it but I keep thinking in 10 years I don&rsquo;t want to be doing the same thing. Also, as I have grown more in figuring &ldquo;Life&rdquo; out the last couple of months I realized I really would like to do something different.</p>
<p>On the same lines, I am reflecting back on an email I sent to a CEO that I have run into from time to time over the past 3 years. The company he works at had a job posted that I was interested in, I didn&rsquo;t think I was qualified and kept dragging my feet for weeks. However, I finally found the courage to ask him if he would mind chatting about it which within an hour he emailed me back the name of the CFO for me to email as well copying himself. In the end, my thoughts were right, they wanted someone with a little more experience but I feel a lot better knowing it wasn&rsquo;t just a missed opportunity.</p>
<p>Do you have any times in your career that you wished you would have spoken up to find out about an opportunity? Or did you have a time that you did speak up and how did it turn out for you, I would love to hear your thoughts, leave them in the comments below.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t born to just pay bills and die.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My wife sent me this quote the other day and it really made me reflect on things so I thought I would share.  I decided to put that quote on a photo I took while hiking with a good friend in Colorado a couple of years back.  In fact, my wife bought me the plane ticket to go see my friend for my birthday and looking back it was a great present as it got me to do what I had been talking about doing since I left college but kept saying to myself I was too busy.</p>
<p>I was more out of shape back then as I hadn&rsquo;t gotten into the swing of running again but it was well worth it once we made it to the top.  It was a gorgeous day and the view from the top of Estes Cone was awesome.  Luckily, the trail we took, which started at Longs Peak Trailhead, wasn&rsquo;t too strenuous and I would suggest it to anyone that finds themselves in the area.</p>
<p>Here are a couple other pictures I took from the peak, hiking up, and from the base of the mountain to give you a feel for how high up we were.</p>

			 <p>Yep, I was the person outside in Minnesota on January 9 when it was -4 degrees running around the streets.</p>
<p>However, since then the weather has been mostly above 0 when I go out on my runs even though most of the time it is around 9:30 pm.  Honestly, I wish I had a better time to do it but I have tried to create a habit in 2016 of running and I tell myself that if night running is my only time, then night running it is.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>###Some Background</p>
<p>Now, for fun here is a little background on my running, I used to be a runner back in High School (long ago) and loved running, still do, but I lost the actual urge to run as I fell into a busy trap.  I could find lots of excuses after college, heck even in college.  I ran off and on my Freshman and Sophomore year just as something to do as at that point I wasn&rsquo;t too buried in the books.  However, I took it up a notch the summer before my Junior year as I conned my brother into running the Twin Cities Marathon with me in October.  I ran ever day all summer no matter what and sometimes 2x per day.  However, once school started up in the fall I never really found time to run as I made excuses.  Never fear, though, I was young and determined to still run the Marathon and I actually finished with very little walking.  However, since that day I have always made excuses and let the excuses win.  I would try from time to time but never keep the momentum.  In fact in spring, summer, and fall of 2015, I think I went on a couple weeks worth of running and then stopped.  Part of my problem I found was I wasn&rsquo;t making the right choice or prioritizing my time correctly and my excuse was always that I could never find the right &ldquo;<em><strong>time</strong></em>&rdquo; to run.</p>
<p>###Starting over again</p>
<p>Fast forward to the start of 2016 and something clicked.  It might have been some of the changes in my life that occurred in 2015, or that I wouldn&rsquo;t mind losing a couple pounds, or maybe I finally remembered that I love running and gives me time to think.  I am honest with myself in knowing that I will not run every day but I would like to run a couple times a week.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is something great about running as it is just pure.  You can only move as fast as you can, as far as you can, and as long as you can.  However, it is all up to you to determine what you &ldquo;can&rdquo; do and what you get out of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me right now I am not worried about the distance, or speed, or length as I just enjoy putting my shoes and going for a run, even if it is below 0.</p>

			 <p>With Google Street View you can now visit Machu Picchu and walk around just as you were there in real life but from your home.  Since I have been fortunate to visit Machu Picchu two times in my life I had to check this out after finding this video published today.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Using Street View to check out the ancient Inca city of Machu Picchu and it is almost just as amazing walking along looking at it on my computer as it was standing there.  Still to this day I remember walking around the site that is sitting at around 7,970 ft (2,430 meters) above sea level.</p>
<p>I decided to find a place on the street view map that I knew I had a photo of as it is hanging up in my house.  Here is two pictures I took back in December 2009 when I last visited there.  As you can see it was a wonderfully rainy/overcast day.  However, that didn&rsquo;t deter us from making the most of it and wandering around the place.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/57adc7121c.jpg" alt="">

<em>Machu Picchu December 2009</em></p>
<p>The specific place at Machu Picchu we took those photos from is called the &ldquo;House of the Guardian to the Funerary Rock.&rdquo;   So I used the Google Street View to find that exact spot show below (you can start there by clicking <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as well).</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/c5cc833a86.jpg" alt="">
<em>Machu Picchu (Google Street View)</em></p>
<p>As you can see the people at Google had great weather and clear blue sky&rsquo;s which makes for a great Street View to click around and see the ancient city.  Another interesting find is that you can actually take a walk on the entire <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Inca Trail to Machu Picchu<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which I have never done before so this was definitely interesting to see what I have missed (*add to bucket list).</p>

<p>Also, if you are into more history you should check out the Google Cultural Institute collection titled <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wonders of Machu Picchu<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as they teamed up with the Peruvian Ministry of Culture for the initiative.</p>
<p>I have so many more stories of my time in Peru that maybe I will share pieces of it at a later date.  However, now that I have scrolled through the Street Views and looking at old pictures again I think I am ready to go back and visit&hellip;</p>

<p>Fast forward a couple of years and Matt is ready to start traveling/dancing again and is going to create a new video for 2016.  So to help fund his project he has a Kickstarter with a couple twists as well.  So check out the video and information below in hopes that the 2016 video is created.</p>

			 <p>I can&rsquo;t believe I missed the announcement that Everything is a Remix by Kirby Ferguson was remastered and all four parts were put together in a nice single video.  I stumbled upon Everything is a Remix a couple years ago and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wrote<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about how great the work was back then.</p>
<p>However, besides the remastered version of his project, I was even more shocked to see that Kirby was running a Kickstarter again for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Five Year Anniversary of Everything is a Remix<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Now, this is where it gets even better, there is a bunch of cool rewards out there and if his project makes it past $20K (at $15K at the time of writing this), he will start work on another Everything is a Remix project.</p>
<p>So watch the video below, and then contribute to his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kickstarter project<!-- raw HTML omitted --> so we can get another great video on this topic.  Then browse some of his websites like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Everything is a Remix<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and his other project he has been working on called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is Not a Conspiracy Theory<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Honestly, how could you not be a fan of Kirby&rsquo;s work as he does amazing research and puts that together in an awesome video story that captures your attention?  Also, don&rsquo;t forget to follow him on Twitter <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@remixeverything<!-- raw HTML omitted --> so you can keep up-to-date on his current projects and anything else.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2015/08/05/uncommon-stock-exit.html">&#34;Uncommon Stock: Exit Strategy&#34; by Eliot Peper</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2015/08/05/uncommon-stock-exit.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2015-08-05 07:46:00 -0600">Aug 5, 2015</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The final book in the Uncommon Stock series hit the shelves on July 29, 2015 and if you were like me you had already pre-ordered it so it would be instantly sent to your Kindle.</p>
<p>If you missed the launch of the Part III, don&rsquo;t worry you can pick it up from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Uncommon-Stock-Exit-Strategy-Book-ebook/dp/B0116B9ILS/">Amazon for only $4.99</a> (it is a steal).</p>
<p>Trust me you will not be disappointed with Part III, just as the first two books were well worth it.  Now if you haven&rsquo;t read them yet I would suggest you read all three in order (here is my take on <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2015/03/18/uncommon-stock-power.html">Part II, Uncommon Stock: Power Play</a>).</p>
<p>I was really excited to see how the whole journey of Mara and James unfolded in this book and it was too perfect that it hit the shelves right before I had a long trip to China.  I started reading it on my long flights and wished I wouldn&rsquo;t have had other things that kept distracting me along the way.</p>
<p>However, since the team I was with never went into work until 8am I had plenty of time after waking up at 4am, as I wasn&rsquo;t able to sleep any longer, to continue reading.  The only bad part about that was I didn&rsquo;t want to put it down when I knew it was time to catch the cab.  Also, it helped that domestic flights in China seem to be delayed often which allowed me to finish the book and write this posting.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Uncommon-Stock-Exit-Strategy-Book-ebook/dp/B0116B9ILS/"><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/f0989fe441.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Now onto Exit Strategy, the story puts you right back into the fast-paced life of the Mozaik startup roller coaster.</p>
<p>Eliot does a great job keeping your thoughts focused on wondering what Mara is going to do next and how are they ever going to take down Maelstrom.  Not to mention you are captivated by the underlying story about Mozaik, the company you have been rooting for since Part 1.  He does a great job walking you through some of the real-life examples of the pains that Startups go through from the beginning all the way through IPOs.  Honestly, this is one of those books that touches on so many topics that it probably appeals to people that like all kinds of books from mystery, suspense and action. Then to top that off it is about this Startup company trying to catch people involved in financial fraud, murder, and deception.</p>
<p>Now I could probably write on and on about what happened but that would just ruin the fun of reading it.  So I will at least give you a couple of my favorite quotes/sayings from the book that stuck out to me.  I think each of these just go to show the amount of information beyond being a good story is packed into this book and more specifically this series.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The short version is that when you lay good code on top of bad code, the result is still bad code.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You can&rsquo;t wait until you had enough time for exercise. You had to make time for it no matter what.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Economics, the science of explaining tomorrow why the predictions you made yesterday didn&rsquo;t come true today.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is something ephemeral but infinitely satisfying about starting something yourself.  Your shit is on the line and you and your team are where the buck stops.  If you get a kick out of that, then you end up having few other employment choices.  If you&rsquo;ve got that bug, you essentially have to start a company or get involved with startups.  Otherwise, your brain starts to rot and you get all bitchy and miserable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, at the end of the book after it is all done (don&rsquo;t worry I am not going to spoil the ending) but Eliot Peper hinted at coming out with a new book (not part of this series) in Spring of 2016.  So if you are like me and enjoy his style of writing you probably should following him on twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/@EliotPeper">@EliotPeper</a>) and subscribe to his newsletter from his <a href="http://www.eliotpeper.com/">website</a>.</p>

			 <p>This isn&rsquo;t going to be the post you are expecting for an introduction as I am really going to talk about why I am taking another Blogging101 course.  However, for those of you that are new to the site, I encourage you to find out more about me by reading my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->About<!-- raw HTML omitted --> page.  So the question is why am I taking yet another Blogging101 course?  The answer is actually pretty simple and you can read why below.  Also, if you are like me and a returning Blogging101 student I would be curious to know why, so let me know in the comments section below.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Giving back by Helping others:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
This is one of the biggest reasons I signed up again to do the Blogging101 course this session.  The last session I made a point to try to search out and find people needing help or having questions on how to do certain things in WordPress.  I actually have a couple different sites that I have helped maintain over the years for Non-Profits, Businesses, and just friends/family members' personal ones.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Forces me to Blog, Learn, and Network:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
It should be easier to make me blog than having to sign up for a course.  However, with everything else going on in life it is not always the first thing I remember to do.  By having the daily reminders to do something on my site helps remind me that I should also start writing something (even if it isn&rsquo;t published that day).  Also, by doing the daily tasks each time, I have learned something new by trying new things and reading/seeing what other people try.  Most importantly the networking part kind of goes with my helping others as it makes you feel part of a community.  However, by signing up it allows/encourages me to find people who are writing about things that I am interested in, and that in turn encourages me to write more as well.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Traveling:
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can see where this one is kind of odd one to put down.  However, I am currently traveling in China for work, in fact, I just landed in Shanghai last night.  Then after I get back to Minnesota for a couple of days before my wife and I head to Seattle for one of our good friend&rsquo;s wedding.  So I thought signing up for this course again would be good as I should have some time to blog during my downtime at hotels, airports, and on airplanes.  Who knows I might even come up with a couple of tips on traveling as we go.</p>

<p>I feel as though I am a reasonable person and tried to everything right by my previous employer.  In fact I even gave them over a months notice that I would be leaving the company.  In all the time I was a manager people only gave me a couple of weeks notice and then I had to scramble to back-fill that individual.  Also, I never remember calling anyone after they left the company to ask how something was done, that was what I had to figure out before the individual left.</p>
<p>In the end though, I always try to exceed people&rsquo;s expectations and I did continue to provide answers to some of their questions as time allowed in the evenings.  Mostly because it is in my nature to be helpful and I didn&rsquo;t really see any reason to burn bridges of the people I worked with for 7 years over a couple of questions here and there (I can say all of this now as I haven&rsquo;t had a question for 3 months).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For a longer read, I will give you more of the back-story as I have not really talked about why I ended up looking for a new job.  It isn&rsquo;t that I have anything bad to say about my previous employer and in fact I enjoyed everyone I worked with and had a great time learning along the way.</p>
<p>Over a year ago the company I used to work for announced it was going to be merging with another company.  It was an exciting time for the company but also left a lot of people worried about what was going to happen.  Honestly, I was never really that worried, I figured I would get an offer to stay at the company doing what I was doing or I would go somewhere else.  In the meantime, before the deal could close there was going to be a lot of work done as I worked in Finance and needed to assist all 3 companies involved.  Budget models needed to be created and vetted out before too long so it wouldn&rsquo;t be done last-minute.</p>
<p>Information was very slow to come from our company about what the future was as far as Corporate location and the big unknown&hellip; Jobs.</p>
<p>As I suspected, I was offered a similar position to what I had with increased responsibilities but that would require me to move out-of-state and away from my family that lives here in the Midwest (this happened about 3 months after the announcement).  I didn&rsquo;t really like that option and at the time that was the only option they had available for me.  I was completely up front with them and said at this time I did not want to move but I realized that my job would no longer be in Minnesota after the company merged.  At that point I made sure they knew I was going to start reaching out to other companies and told them I would continue to be open and honest about what I was thinking.  They confirmed my thoughts on my current position by saying they are sorry I wouldn&rsquo;t take the offer.  Also, they wanted me to know that my job wasn&rsquo;t going away on day one and they would try to find something else before then.</p>
<p>About 4 months after the offer I went back to the same individuals and told them that I had found another job and was giving them my month notice with a couple of conditions attached.  The reason for the conditions was mostly because I knew it would be helpful to them if I stayed until January and in turn that could help me so I could spend a week watching my 2 young girls and working here and there that week.</p>
<p>Looking back how the whole process went, I think the lack of communication was the biggest downfall from what I could observe.  There was too much unknown for people and some of the people willing to stick it out were asked to leave at a later day due to synergies.  It didn&rsquo;t help that on top of that a good handful of the upper management were not sticking with the merged company (where most people were going) and were either retiring or going with the new company.</p>
<p>Another question for anyone that has made it this far&hellip; Have you had an experience with a company merging of equal size and or spinning off a portion of a company, if so how did it go?</p>

			<h1><a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2015/07/07/all-house-projects.html">All house projects are not created equal - Replacing interior Doors</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2015/07/07/all-house-projects.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2015-07-07 09:31:47 -0600">Jul 7, 2015</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Replacing interior doors in your house should not be a hard task to accomplish.  Just measure the rough opening, purchase a new door that should fit in the rough opening, and then install the new door in a matter of minutes.  However, if your house is like mine and you had previous owners like me you will understand why there is nothing &ldquo;easy&rdquo; or &ldquo;standard&rdquo; when it comes to house projects.</p>
<p>To spare you the long story I will jump right in that I needed to replace the downstairs bathroom door and jam (frame).  Should be an easy task right?  Think again.  I quickly realized after taking the door and molding off that the rough opening of the door was not even close to a standard size but yet they somehow took a standard door and shoved it into the opening they had.  Very classic for my house and I really shouldn&rsquo;t have expected anything less.  So that left me with two decisions:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Once the frame nice and snug in the rough opening it was time to cut the door down to size as of course it was too tall.  Now this is not as tough of a task but since I was using hollow core doors it added to the challenge as I was taking more than 2 inches off the bottom.  Which means that the bottom of the door would have been left open as I would be cutting the entire filling piece off.  Since this had already happened to me before for some closet doors I replaced I already had a solution.</p>
<p>In order to make a nice cut and not chip your wood up to much I would suggest putting a line of painters tap on both sides.  You will probably still have some chipping but it will help reduce it.  After you make the cut you will want to clean out the spacing foam/cardboard to make room for a new cap.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you have the right materials around you can cut a new piece of wood for the filler.  If that is the case make sure you are measuring from the outside edges and not the center of the hole.  Otherwise, another option in a pinch is to use the old filler from the part you cut.  However, it takes a little bit of work pealing the outside paneling away without breaking the cap.  Either way works as I have done both before.  Finally, to secure it in place I would suggest using glue and then tack it with a brad nailer.</p>
<p>Here is the finished product which tuned out nice after spending about 2 hrs more than I had hoped to.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Follow-up:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> So after writing all of this I decided to see if anyone had a video of a similar process that I took of cutting the hollow-core door.  I was in luck as Rick Arnold published a video on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FineHomeBuilding<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that is pretty much identical to what I did. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Finally got around to putting some real thoughts into the book I read a while back called “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Uncommon Stock: Power Play<!-- raw HTML omitted -->” by Eliot Peper.  I actually got and read this book right around the time it was published back in November/December but things started to pick up at my old job and I never got a chance to put the rest of my thoughts in writing about the book.</p>
<p>The book is very captivating as it is about a Startup company that gets caught up in a money laundering scheme.  One of the great things I like about this book is that it discusses real issues that I have heard founders face in Startups today, which is then mixed into the suspense of the characters lives.</p>
<p>Eliot&rsquo;s style of writing is very engaging and hard to put down.  However, if you do have to <em><strong>HAVE</strong></em> to put it down because a child is crying or children or fighting it isn&rsquo;t hard to pick right back up where you left off.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Overall, it is a great book and I would suggest picking it up from FG Press since at only $4.95 for a digital version it is a steal.  Then why you are there you might as well pick up the Uncommon Stock book in the series titled &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Uncommon Stock: Version 1.0<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; as it only costs under five dollars as well.</p>
<p>Finally, Eliot is planning on publishing another books in this series this year titled Uncommon Stock: Exit Strategy, which I can&rsquo;t wait to read.  To make sure you don&rsquo;t miss out and are in the know on his upcoming book you should probably following him on twitter (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->@EliotPeper<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) and subscribe to his newsletter from his website (<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.eliotpeper.com/">http://www.eliotpeper.com/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>

		<a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2015/02/25/thoughts-on-medium.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2015-02-25 12:46:37 -0600">Feb 25, 2015</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>For the last couple of months, I have been more interested in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Medium<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as some of the writers/bloggers I follow have been cross-posting to there. It is actually a very interesting platform as it seems to attract people who want to write longer articles and don&rsquo;t really have a personal site to do so. Also, since it is a place that houses a collection of public writings from various people on various topics it allows people who don&rsquo;t get there writing exposed to the masses a better shot of getting more exposure.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However, with yesterday&rsquo;s post by Founder Ev Williams titled &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->A Less Long, More Connected Medium<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; it starts to make you wonder what new audiences this will draw to the platform. Before you didn&rsquo;t see many people post short posts on Medium as there wasn&rsquo;t that Feed as you would find on Twitter, Facebook, or Tumblr. However, talking more specifically about Tumblr it seems as though that might be the targeted audience as you can continue to write longer posts/writings that people are more accustom to in Medium.</p>
<p>As I was thinking more and more about the shift in new features I was reminded of an article that Hunter Walk wrote a couple of years back titled &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ev Williams’ Medium is Blogging for the 9%<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&rdquo; In there he talked about the internet rule of 1%-9%-90% and equated to WordPress, Medium, and Tumbler respectively. As I do believe that is still true I am wondering how much of a shift will happen with the new Feeds and Shorter posts that may or may not start occur on Medium going forward.</p>
<p>Time will tell and it will be interesting to see how it plays out. I wonder if by allowing shorter posts will lead to less fully original content (as Hunter Walk attributed to Tumbler in his article) on Medium and create more noise on the platform than before. In fact, it might make it harder to find the rich stories/articles that were once easier to stumble upon.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on the change to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Medium<!-- raw HTML omitted -->?</p>

<p>From the title of this video you are probably thinking you have read a number of articles about how you can find fulfilling work and why would you waste you time watching one more video.  However, being someone who has worked at different companies in various roles I think this advice is more spot on than the rest.  It isn&rsquo;t necessary saying anything different but pointing out you aren&rsquo;t always going to get it right and more importantly it is going to take time to get right.</p>

<p>As the first full week of 2015 is coming to a close I couldn&rsquo;t help but think this quote was perfect as I started a new job on Monday of this week.  I am not starting a job in the way that Christian describes it in the video, as I gave my previous employer about a month&rsquo;s notice and wrapped up all my outstanding tasks.  However, my new job was really me taking control of my career as the other options in front of me I wasn&rsquo;t as excited about.  So I decided to take that step outside of my past 6.5 year comfort zone and I found another company that I could get behind, enjoyed the people I met and hopefully I will be able to do great things for.</p>

			 <p>I can&rsquo;t believe I missed the video below as it practically happened in my own backyard. However, you have to watch this video of 5th grader Cordell Steiner giving a TEDx presentation at the University of St. Thomas about the benefits of video games in the classroom to further students learning. First of all, how impressive that he stood up in front of the audience and gave such a presentation.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You can tell that Cordell is very enthusiastic about education through failure as it is just as instructive as classroom success. He makes some really good points in the video and it is refreshing hearing a kids perspective on how video games (or Apps) can really help every student learn to their full potential.</p>
<p>I think with technology changing it is only right that education and how students are taught will change as well. My son started kindergarten this year and everyone in the school has iPads. I have been fortunate to help out in the classroom on a couple of occasions and watch how the kids use the iPads first hand. Most of the Educational Applications they use could probably be considered games as they try to encourage students by keeping a tally of right and wrong answers. Also, from what I could tell most of the Apps would change automatically change the difficulty as the child answered more and more correct. There were other Apps that allowed the teacher to set a baseline of what level the student was at and she could track their progress of how they are doing by easy to view reports on her computer. They don&rsquo;t use iPads as the only way to learn as the teacher still does instruction as we all remember. I would estimate that they only use the iPads at most an hour a day (over the course of a week).</p>
<p>As a parent and technology enthusiast I actually like that they are using technology to assist and educate my child. I know for a fact that by allowing him to have some time to learn at his own pace using the educational Apps has only furthered his interest in learning by continuing to keep him challenged.</p>
<p><em><strong>What are your thoughts about the use of video games or apps in education?</strong></em></p>

			 <p>This is a very long overdue post about a book I read titled “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sleep your way to the Top (and other myths about business success)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->” by Jane Miller.  I was actually lucky enough to get a copy from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FG Press<!-- raw HTML omitted --> not long after I had <!-- raw HTML omitted -->written<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about the number of books I had been listening to so far in 2014.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/90a39628fe.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Honestly, when I got the email with instructions on where to get the book I had no idea what the book was about.  Since I was lucky enough to get a copy of the book, I decided to take the challenge of reading it. It was defiantly worth my time and I would encourage anyone and everyone to read this book.  It is packed with great life lessons/thoughts based on the situations, successes, and mistakes that Jane made.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;No decision is a bad decision&hellip; if you learn from it.&rdquo; - Jane Miller</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It touches on various topics like resume writing, interviewing, being a team player, and when is the right time to leave a company.  At the end of each chapter, there are questions to ask yourself, that I believe are designed to make you more aware of your strengths and weaknesses.  Also, depending on where you are in your career you can use some of the questions/situations she poses to help you try to figure out what your dream job is and how that may or may not relate to your current job/role.</p>
<p>I wish I could have read this book when I was in college getting ready to graduate as there are some really good life lessons that everyone goes through in the world of business.  The best part is that all of those tips and lessons are embedded in a funny and captivating story.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Let me tell you something. You stupid little runt.  I own you. You&rsquo;re my bitch.  So don&rsquo;t walk around here thinking you have free will, because you don&rsquo;t.  I could crush you anytime I want.  So settle in, &lsquo;cause you are here for the long haul.&rdquo; - Dave Harkien, Horrible Bosses (film)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finishing this book was really easy, the only painful part was my lack of sleep since I couldn&rsquo;t put the book down as I always wanted to finish another chapter before shutting my eyes.</p>
<p>So if you are looking for a good book to read I would definitely encourage you to find this book and while you are at it check out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jane Miller&rsquo;s website<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to read other things she has written.</p>

			 <p>The weather is finally turning cold in Minnesota and that means that people are starting to think of the one sport everyone in Minnesota seems to play&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->HOCKEY!<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>For some background, I grew up in Iowa never playing or really watching hockey.  Once I moved to Minnesota after college I started watching Hockey and have even taken up skating.  It really must be something in the air or water here as my kids talk about hockey all the time and it seems to be on their mind all the time <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(Not that I am complaining)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  For that reason, when I had the opportunity to acquire some boards last year to set up my rink in the backyard I took advantage of it.  Some of my friends outside the state of Minnesota are shocked that we actually flooded the backyard to create a rink to skate on.  Honestly, it does sound a little strange but the whole family had a blast skating and playing hockey on it last year.  The best part was you didn&rsquo;t have to get in the car, or walk down the street to enjoy it.</p>
<p>Since the weather has been turning colder and there was snow in the forecast, I spent some of the weekend setting the rink up to ensure I was ready for the season.  I was lucky that some family was in town to do some of the heavy lifting/swinging to get everything setup in really good time.  Here is how it looked as of Sunday night with the Boards up, and the tarp clipped down.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There were two things I did differently from last year:</p>

			 <p>I have never really thought it mattered to me as I have had a blog for a couple years but have never really consistently published stuff.   So I used the cheaper alternative of using WordPress.org (or a self-hosted site) because I have had the server and storage space for some other projects I work on.  It works well for me and I appreciate being able to have full control of the site and can make any changes as necessary.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However, after publishing my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->first assignment for Blogging101<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I realized that there are a few differences between the two depending on what you are looking for.  Specifically for this course, I realized that my posts might not get as much attention as others since they don&rsquo;t show up in the WordPress.com Reader under the Blogging101 tag and there is not an easy Follow button at the top of my site.  Thinking about that a little more I realized that by having my own Self-hosted site I really would miss out on the community part of my WordPress experience.</p>
<p>I decided to do some more digging on finding the differences and see if there was anything out there that could help bridge the gap but I couldn&rsquo;t find anything.  In my searching thought I found a couple of useful articles:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>With that information, I was left to ponder the question that I had never really thought about before.  Which platform is better for me now?  Ultimately, I decided to buy a new domain name called StillThinking.me, which will be the blog I use going forward for the time being.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I will miss having more control over my site by using plugins and other customization.  The nice thing is that no matter which you choose WordPress.com or WordPress.org you can easily import/export to either if you change your mind down the road.</p>
<p>So what platform are you using?  Have you ever moved from one platform to the other?  What do you feel is the pros/cons of each?</p>

			 <p>In a hope to continue to jump-start my writing on this blog I decided to sign up for a Blogging 101 course through <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Daily Post<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I have blogged off and on for many years now but only seriously thought about putting my blog together about 3 years ago (that wasn’t for family travel/photo purposes).</p>

<h3 id="so-why-the-change">So why the change?</h3>
<p>About a month ago a friend of mine shared with me a new site he stumbled upon called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Known<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I was very intrigued as I am with most things and signed up to get a better idea of how it worked and what you could do with it.  The main use (and tagline) is to have a place for sharing content and discussing ideas.  I thought the idea is great and probably has good use for a number of people.  Then as I was going to make my first post I realized I already have a place to do that and that is here on this WordPress blog.  All of their selling points of publishing words, pictures, podcasts and sharing them with the networks you use is exactly what I can do with this site today.  So instead of having another site with just random things, I find interesting I figured I should just do that here.  So there you have it, that is why I have changed what I post and I hope you have found some of the new things interesting.</p>

			 <p>I have been spending a lot of my spare time lately <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reading<!-- raw HTML omitted --> listening to books.   So far this year I have completed 24 books (listened to 22, read 2).  I won&rsquo;t list out all of the books as it probably wouldn&rsquo;t be all that interesting but if you are curious you can check it out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I have found that listening to books is a good way to pass the time while working on various house projects (e.g., Painting the House).</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/dd1eac7b57.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Also, I stumbled upon the author <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David Baldacci<!-- raw HTML omitted --> who has some really good books out there.  The topics of his books are around espionage, war zones, traitors and good guys on a mission to contain/eliminate the problems of the people who don&rsquo;t have the United States interests at heart.  If you are interested in those types of Spy/Detective books I would really encourage you to check out the many books he has written (<a href="http://davidbaldacci.com/)">http://davidbaldacci.com/)</a>.  My favorite series so far is The Camel Club.</p>
<p>So what is next for my book reading?  I might take a little break from listening to books and go back to actually reading a couple books that have been in the queue (partially because there isn&rsquo;t an audiobook for them).   What books are you reading or any suggestions you have of good books I should check out?  Leave it in the comments section.</p>
<p>Another reason, I might slow my reading/listening to books down is I have been thinking of picking up a couple new projects in the near future.  I have a couple of ideas but need to put some more thought on what I hope to accomplish and then reach out for some advice.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This week has been busy.  The company I work for has a 3/31 year end and seeing how I am a Finance guy there is a lot of stuff happening and trying to get done before that date.  The nice thing is that my company has every other Friday off and this is one of them.  I decided to take this morning to step away from work stuff and slow down.</p>
<p>While I was having my coffee this morning and reading news I ran across an article from earlier this week by Hanna Rosin titled  &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Your not as busy as you say you are<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The answer to feeling oppressively busy, is to stop telling yourself that you’re oppressively busy, because the truth is that we are all much less busy than we think we are.&rdquo; - John Robinson</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article referenced a previous article that I had red by Tim Kreider titled &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Busy Trap<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; which I stumbled on a while back after reading an article that Brad Feld wrote called &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Have You Fallen Into The Busy Trap?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;  Check all of them out if you have time as each are very interesting but in the end the message is the same that everyone seems to be creating their own sense of busyness.</p>
<p>With two kids (ages 2 and almost 5), both my wife and I working full-time, we are busy.  However, it is true that some things we bring on ourselves and they really shouldn&rsquo;t be considered the busy part of your life.  Work is busy because it is work and I don&rsquo;t want to focus on that too much but you are probably working at the job you are for a variety of reasons.  Outside of work the things you do (e.g., volunteering, social gatherings, kids activities) you shouldn&rsquo;t have the mindset that all of that is making your life too busy.  In fact what you choose to do on the weekends and at nights are optional.</p>
<p>For my wife and I, we understand it is good to have kids involved in things but we don&rsquo;t want extra activities taking up our kids lives or ours.  So we have allowed them to each sign up for one activity which could either be at nights or on the weekends.  We feel this is important as we don&rsquo;t want them to be so involved in outside activities that they miss just being a child.  The same thing is true for being an adult, you don&rsquo;t want to miss out on spending quality time with your family, friends, significant other or maybe having a couple of hours to yourself.  You need to make sure you are not so busy with scheduled events and activities that you can&rsquo;t just slow down and enjoy the present.</p>
<p>There is some families we know who have their kids in every activity possible which is good for them.  However, I don&rsquo;t feel bad for them if they tell me they are so busy with work and the kids that they can&rsquo;t do anything else.  If the parents are saying that how do you think the kids feel?  I mean they are never at their house to play with any of their own toys or just do interesting kids stuff.  I remember as a kid having lots of down time to do whatever I wanted and that was even being in lots of activities as well.</p>
<p>Tim Kreider said it best at the end of his article which I have modified to portray my own thoughts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it’s possible I’ll lie on my deathbed regretting that I didn’t work harder and say everything I had to say, but I think what I’ll really wish is that I could have one more beer with friends, another long talk with my wife April, read one more story to my children, and have one last family gathering.  Life is too short to be busy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now with that said I just called up my brother and am going to meet him for lunch.</p>

			 <p>If it&rsquo;s a deadline, email, phone call, blogging, or working out everyone has something they procrastinate about and always say, &ldquo;I wish I could do better.&rdquo;  So, what is the &ldquo;Seinfeld Strategy&rdquo; and how does it work you are probably wondering.  The advice that Jerry Seinfeld gave to Brad Issac (<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->LifeHacker<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->), who wanted to be a better comic, was simple, &ldquo;Write everyday and don&rsquo;t break the chain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More specifically this is what Seinfeld told him to do:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&ldquo;Get a big wall calendar that has a whole year on one page and hang it on a prominent wall. Then get a big red magic marker. For each day that you complete your task of writing, put a big red X over that day.</p>
<p>Then after a few days you&rsquo;ll have a chain. Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day.  You&rsquo;ll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job next is to not break the chain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I actually read an article published by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->James Clear<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> from <!-- raw HTML omitted --> The <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Huffington Post<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> six months ago which referenced the same story and had his own take on the matter. I remember telling myself I needed to get back to writing as it has been an area I would like to improve on in my older/wiser years. Well, fast forward six months and I saw the same article written again by James Clear but for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Entrepreneur<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>That reminded me that I had this blog post started from back then and I never did complete it or follow the advice at that time.</p>
<p>However, this time when I read the article I was reflecting on how I have been using the &ldquo;Seinfeld Strategy&rdquo; by writing more and more each week (I finally started in January).  Not everything I write gets the publish button pushed, but nevertheless there is writing being done so that I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->don&rsquo;t break the chain<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It is just one of those days that I was reminded of an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@IgniteBoulder<!-- raw HTML omitted --> video I saw last summer by Casey Hopkins (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->@caseyhopkins<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) who talked about how to &ldquo;Build Your Geek Resume.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;With all of these hobbies granting real world skill, who knows what the future has in store.  All we know is that there will always be more hobbies to inspire the future generation of resumes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I felt like she made a great correlation between how hobbies assisted with gaining real world knowledge.  If you ever want to create something new or be an entrepreneur start with what you know, the best way to do it is to find something you have a passion for.</p>
<p>Take the 5 min and watch her presentation and if you are a &ldquo;Geek&rdquo; it will defiantly be worth it.  If you aren&rsquo;t, well it will still be a good listen for 5 min.</p>

<p>Ran across this picture today and found it to be fitting with how most Plans and Planning goes compared to what the reality.  However, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you should forget about planning because you just want to roll with the punches.  In fact the picture above should remind you of the opposite.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail!&rdquo;  - Benjamin Franklin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remind yourself that a plan is never set in stone and problems/issues will most likely present themselves during the execution process.  When unforeseen issues arise you should use that time to reevaluate the current plan/outcome and make modifications as necessary.  How you handle those issues will prove to be the ultimate success or failure of the outcome.  You might find that what you thought you wanted as an outcome is not the best anymore and you will be glad you reevaluated it during the process.</p>

<p>One of my favorite quotes in the video is the one he shares from Dr. Seuss and for some reason really hits home with me as it reminds me very much of my wife and I as we are both weird.</p>

			 <p>I stumbled upon Kirby Ferguson because of the TED Talk video that was posted a few days ago.  I would encourage you to watch the video as it really starts to make you think about copyright laws.  One of my favorite quotes is &ldquo;Everything is a Remix, until you are the one getting remixed.&rdquo;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>via <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TED: Kirby Ferguson: Embrace the remix - Kirby Ferguson (2012)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Part 2 of my Post</p>
<p>After doing a little more research on <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kirby<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Ferguson<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I ended up watching a couple more videos titled Everything is a Remix, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Part 1<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Part 2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Part 3<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Part 4<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from his site <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Everything is a Remix<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I am still shocked that the opening to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stairway to Heaven<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Led Zeppelin was copied from Spirits song titled <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Taurus<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I guess it goes to emphasize one of Kerby&rsquo;s quotes that says &ldquo;Creativity isn&rsquo;t Magic, it happens by applying ordinary tools of thoughts to existing materials&rdquo;.  Also, another one of the quotes that is pointed to a specific company is &ldquo;When we copy we justify it, when others copy we vilify it.&rdquo;  In addition to the videos described above he recently had a Kickstarter video project funded earlier this year titled &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is Not a Conspiracy Theory<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;.  Even though the KickStarter project is closed and fully funded, I would encourage you to donate to his work from his website if you think the videos <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Every Thing Is A Remix<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, were as interesting as I did.</p>
<p>As I too have not created anything new by this post, I would like to again re-quote something from the videos, &ldquo;I invented nothing new.  I simply assembled the discoveries of other men behind whom were centuries of work.  Had I worked fifty or ten or even five years before, I would have failed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keep up the good work Kirby and I look forward to seeing more of your work.</p>

			 <p>A couple weeks ago we went to the zoo and took our Cannon Digital XLR camera along as we always do in order to capture pictures of our kids.  However, after a full morning of taking pictures we got home and were going to load them on the Mac when we got a lovely message that the camera card needed to be reformatted and no pictures were found&hellip;</p>
<p>WHAT!?</p>
<p>I was sure that was a mistake, so we plugged it into a few other machines but each one said the same thing. For my family we love to take pictures and have been doing it for a long time.  About 8 years ago we went to Peru for vacation and took 100+ pictures a day for each of the 14 days we were there.  So after realizing that the Card was &ldquo;Really&rdquo; not working right I started looking for any type of software that could help recover our pictures from the day.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/ab49f40d0f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say if you want to check and see if you have a chance of recovering anything you can easily do a quick Google search and find a lot of trial software.  I ended up installing a few of them from companies that I felt I could trust.  The nice thing about most of the trial software is that you could run the SD Card recovery and get a preview of the photos it found before you had to purchase the full version.  In the end we bought the eSupport.com product called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Undelete Plus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and were able to get all of the photos back from that day.  In reality this seemed like a lot of the other products but I liked that this one can restore more than just pictures and videos like the other two I was reviewing.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Update:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->After this issue happened we decided to use our old CF Camera card we purchased at the same time as our camera.  Also, we just got back from a 2 week vacation of taking pictures with no issues.  I think in looking back the issue relied in the CF Card Adapter as we had previously tried to replace the SD card.</p>

			 <p>I just wanted to start off again by saying this shouldn&rsquo;t have taken as long as it did but it wasn&rsquo;t of the highest priority over the past three years.  Not that I didn&rsquo;t want to get it done but when owning a house that needs fixing up, you have to tackle things one at a time, which normally means 10 projects going at the same time.</p>
<p>If you have never done any projects like this before it is defiantly a learning experience and I am not sure if I would have been able to do it without the help of the internet (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->YouTube<!-- raw HTML omitted --> specifically).  In fact, come to think of it there is so much information/tutorials out on the internet it is surprising what you could probably put together without really starting with much knowledge of a process.</p>
<p>I think the biggest thing I learned through the process is that when you are trying to remake something you always run into 100 more unforeseen problems. One of the biggest scratch-your-head moments was when I was ready to put the Sheetrock back up and on the vanity side, a pipe was sitting farther out than the studs. I have no idea how that was even possible since I didn&rsquo;t replace or move that pipe or the studs. Needless to say, I had to run to my local Home Depot and get the thinnest boards I could find in order to space the Sheetrock out another 1/8 of an inch. However, there were other issues I ran into as well, which required me to rerun all the electrical in the room causing some delay once I knocked down the ceiling, or replacing a rotten floorboard (wonder if the floor or shower leaked for the previous owners).</p>
<p>Overall, I actually do enjoy working on projects like this and seeing everything come together in the end.  Additionally, I am frugal with my money when it comes to things &ldquo;I could do&rdquo; or as my wife puts it things &ldquo;I think I can do.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>So it has been over a month since my last post but for good reason. My daughter (second child) was born not long after that so that has been keeping me a little more occupied that normal.</p>
<p>With this wonderful delay in my life, it additionally allowed me to give my homebrew some additional time to sit.  Now that I had a few moments to spare I finally decided to give it a taste.  I might be bias but I think it turned out pretty good for my first time back at it.  In fact, I was able to taste the hint of Maple Syrup in the beer.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/64cfe92bc4.jpg" alt="">
<em>Maple Syrup Dark Ale</em></p>
<p>I have been wanting to brew another batch of a different kind but I haven&rsquo;t found the time to do that yet.</p>
<p>However, just because I haven&rsquo;t found the time to do any other homebrews don&rsquo;t think everything has been put on the back burner.  I have still been working my project but it is still not quite where I would like it to be.  I have finished a house project of redoing the master bathroom as well as painting our master bedroom (I will put more pictures and time in an upcoming post to show the long process).   Then to top it off, things have been really busy at work lately as well as another person in our department has decided to leave.  However, I can&rsquo;t fault her since she is not moving for a better job in town, she is moving to be with her boyfriend out in California because he got a job out there.</p>
<p>Well time to get ready for another work week.</p>

			 <p>Two things that I have been devoting my time outside of work on these days, besides my family as well which we are expecting an addition to arrive any day now.</p>
<p>I have been working on this side project from time to time for quite a few years now and it has just finally taken a different direction as I have always wanted it to.  I apologize that I am not giving out all the information now but I am still working pretty hard on it to get it to a finalized state so it is usable by the time my customer needs it.  Additionally, I feel by writing it quickly on a Monday morning I will not give enough details in to who this project came about and some ideas I have for the future of the project.</p>
<p>It has been about 4 years since I brewed beer more frequently and I have finally gotten around to picking the hobby back up again.  I decided to grab a kit in December from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Midwest Supplies<!-- raw HTML omitted --> called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Maple Syrup Dark Ale<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Lets just say that day was a learning experience as my first batch (yes I had to do two), I was rushing to much and not checking the size of my boiling pot.  Needless to say I did it a second time paying close attention to all the details and I am hopeful this batch is going to turn out good.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/bc522b3cc7.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>On January 8th moved it from the carboy to bottles and am now just waiting patiently to see if it turned out good or if I am going to have to pour all the bottles down the drain.  If this one and a few more turn out good, I will post a few tips and tricks that I have found useful to anyone wanting to pick the hobby up.  However, I have to wait to post them to ensure the tips and tricks I remember produce the beer I remember.</p>
<p>Well that is all I have for a Monday evening.</p>

<p>I will work on another post tonight to let you know of some things I have been working on.</p>

			 <p>So much for trying to keep up with this blog as you can tell from my previous posts.  I guess I have been busy with life in general and other random things.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, I have been working on this other project that I have made a lot of progress on but can&rsquo;t seem to get the client to agree to the final part.  This has made me put that project on hold for the last couple of weeks which has actually worked out well and has given me time to to help a non-profit in Iowa with a couple of things.  Also, I was able to prepare for winter or really my wifes need for wanting a fire all the time by splitting a bunch of wood last Friday.</p>

<p>Finally, I have been paying more attention to the Craft Beer scene here around the Twin Cities but even in Minnesota in general and it is really blowing up.  I will make another post specifically about that as I might stop by the Golden Nugget tonight to try another some more new beers from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lucid Brewing<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>Ok, so how long has it been since I posted my &ldquo;first&rdquo; blog post to start this?  Let&rsquo;s not answer it as it is the post right before this and probably should be deleted anyways.</p>
<p>This week has been a very busy week both with my family, work wise and what I will call my hobbies/interests.  However, as I keep thinking about writing blog two things happen: 1) not really knowing what to put here and 2) when I do think of things things to put here I let to much time laps and never get it done.</p>
<p>Now insert the video I stumbled upon yesterday while catching up on some news titled Procrastination.  I have not read the book but here is the trailer, which hits home for me.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Next question you probably would have is what have I learned by watching the video.  To be honest nothing more than what I already knew but it did make me think about all the things in my life I have procrastinated about by doing other things first.  However, maybe with that video and other things that have happened this week, they have given me a renewed interest in my own interests that I say I never have time for.</p>
<p>I guess time will tell.</p>

			 <p>It is about time I create an actual blog site.  I used/use Postures for a while but realized that I needed something else.  Not that I was posting or using it that much that I needed to upgrade but it seems most people use that for quick posts or sharing items and still have a blog that allows them to write more.  So&hellip; this is where all of that thinking has brought me.  If you are asking yourself what this blog will bring, I am not sure.</p>

			 <p>I just ran across this article published by CNN Money titled &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The most ridiculous job interview questions<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;.  All I will say is I am sure the interviewee gets a good kick out of the answers for some of these questions.  However, in reading through them here are a few of my favorite brain teasers, can you figure them out?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You have a bouquet of flowers. All but two are roses, all but two are daisies, and all but two are tulips. How many flowers do you have?&rdquo; &ndash; Epic Systems&quot;You have three boxes. One contains only apples, one contains only oranges, and one contains both apples and oranges. The boxes have been incorrectly labeled so that no label accurately identifies the contents of any of the boxes. Opening just one box, and without looking inside, you take out one piece of fruit. By looking at the fruit, how can you immediately label all of the boxes correctly?&quot; &ndash; Apple</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have five bottles of pills. One bottle has 9 gram pills, the others have 10 gram pills. You have a scale that can be used only once. How can you find out which bottle contains the 9 gram pills?&rdquo; &ndash;eBay</p>

			 <p>So I realized I have not been doing very good updating this so far.  I guess things have been busy with my day job and trying to save the world&hellip; errr&hellip;  Anyways, I got this email from a friend today and thought I would share.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>Three accountants and three engineers are traveling by train to a conference. At the station, the three engineers each buy tickets and watch as the three accountants buy only a single ticket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are three people going to travel on only one ticket?&rdquo; asks an engineer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch and you&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; answers an accountant.</p>
<p>They all board the train. The engineers take their respective seats but all three accountants cram into a rest room and close the door behind them. Shortly after the train has departed, the conductor comes around collecting tickets. He knocks on the rest room door and says, &ldquo;Ticket, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door opens just a crack and a single arm emerges with a ticket in hand. The conductor takes it and moves on.</p>
<p>The engineers saw this and agreed it was quite a clever idea.</p>
<p>So after the conference, the engineers decide to copy the accountants on the return trip and save some money (knowing that accountants are clever with money) . When they get to the station, they buy a single ticket for the return trip.</p>
<p>To their astonishment, the accountants don&rsquo;t buy a ticket at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you going to travel without a ticket?&rdquo; says one perplexed engineer. &ldquo;Watch and you&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; answers an accountant.</p>
<p>When they board the train, the three accountants cram into a rest room and the three engineers cram into another one nearby.</p>
<p>The train departs. Shortly afterward, one of the accountants leaves his rest room and walks over to the rest room where the engineers are hiding.</p>
<p>He knocks on the door and says, &ldquo;Ticket, please.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>I have realized today that it has been hard to focus on work lately as my mind has been searching else where.  However, in some emails that I received from a non-profit that I assist with outside of work I realized what developers sometime miss.  Not to make this generalized but in my experience some developers forget about the overall goal.  For instance this non-for-profit, their main goal was to spice up their website which I really think is a good idea.  However, if you asked me the second point needed to be stressed that it was easy to use.  So instead we have a nice product that is not as user friendly in the back end and I have been troubleshooting something I didn&rsquo;t create.  Not that I am unable to assist it is just not my day job.</p>
<p>Well didn&rsquo;t mean to group all developers into that group, since I realize I have developed things.  However, I have ran into this experience a few times so thought I would share.</p>
