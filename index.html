			 <p>Decided to change my plans today and surprise this girl for lunch today 😁. She had been begging us for the last month now that visitors can come into the school and seeing how this is the last week of school it had to get done.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I think the other kids were quite jealous of the food I brought because she said <em><strong>everyone</strong></em> else’s parents bring this. Come to find out they all want it but no one brings it. 😆</p>
<p>It is interesting to think that she is in 1st grade and almost done with this year and I have never really been in her classroom. Some of it is she it at a different school than her siblings but also with COVID protocols the past 2 years we were never really allowed in the school much. So it was also fun for me to see where they eat lunch and the hallways she walks down every day.</p>

			 <p>I like how well the Apple AirPods just work with my iPhone. Only over the last year have I switched almost all of my personal devices back to <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/08/20/new-devices.html">Apple devices</a> and today I was reminded why it just makes sense and it just works.</p>
<p>With the upcoming weekend, I had a block of time this morning that I could get a longer than normal done during the workday. Since we are camping this weekend I wasn’t sure what the long weekend would bring.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/f8ea3bbcf9.jpg" alt="iPod Pro and iPhone 13 Mini"></p>
<p>I only got about 1.5 miles into my run this morning when I got the text (<em>that was conveniently spoken to me</em>) from our Grocery shopper that they are going to start shopping for us. <em>I am not sure why my wife put my number for them to contact but it probably works as I am in front of a computer most days and she is a teacher in front of kids.</em> However, I was able to respond easily to the shopper on her questions about substitutions for the entire run. I never had to stop once to grab my phone out and respond and I was listening to a Podcast in between the times that she would ask me another question. It was honestly just so simple to listen to what she asked me and then say “<strong>reply</strong>” and respond with my answer. I exchanged 10 messages with her until she finally sent me the note saying she was done and I would get an email shortly. This was conveniently 1 mile before I was done and I was ok with the fact that all of this happened as I was doing something else. I didn’t have much else going on during that run but I would have been frustrated if I would have had to stop every mile and try to respond to her on my phone instead of just plugging away at the miles while <em>texting</em> her back.</p>
<p>Times when technology works the way it is intended (or maybe not intended) for me just blows my mind. Some people probably would not enjoy such a disruption as I had today but I didn’t mind it at all as I might have otherwise been stuck with groceries I didn’t want or ones I would have happily taken a replacement for but never responded to say so.</p>

			 <p>This book was just <strong>awesome</strong>! I had been looking for a book to read and this one dropped into my lap at the right time.</p>
<p>I have been a big fan of Eliot’s books in the past and this one again is not a disappointment and somehow seems to take it to the next level.</p>
<p>Due to a busy schedule of kids' activities, it took me a while to actually pick up <a href="https://eliotpeper.com/books/reap3r">Reap3r</a> and start reading it but once I did I could not put it down. The bite-sized chapters and fast-paced book kept me wanting to read more and find out what happened and unfolded next.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/9fb2a72db8.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Well, what more can I say that you should go pick up a copy when it is <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reap3r-Eliot-Peper-ebook/dp/B09PZNWKGQ">released on May 18th</a></strong>. Eliot does it again by doing a great job of keeping the book relevant enough in today&rsquo;s world in both technology, political, and environmental issues that help make a near future book seems believable and real. With out spoiling too much some of the things he brings up in the book is crazy to think he wrote those parts more than 2 years before publishing and some of the ideas and thoughts he put in the book came true 😳. I think that is why I love his books so much. No matter how fast-paced or near future he makes the books they don’t feel that far out on the horizon of technology and the issues seem like they might be something we will need to address in our lifetime.</p>
<p>The story has many key characters that each have their own stories and at the start, you keep trying to figure out how everything is going to fit together. That is where the magic of his writing takes place as he weaves each of the characters' stories together. There are past friendships / acquaintances with secrets to hide which is how they ended up where they are today. Then there are newer characters that have created something amazing and are now being thrust into the mix and trying to put all the pieces together.</p>
<p>Not to mention Eliot&rsquo;s attention to detail throughout the book I always appreciate as I can picture the places he is talking about and it makes me feel like I am there seeing the sights and sounds. Also, how can I forget if you have read some or all of Eliot’s books you might find some tie-ins or mentions of technology, and/or people from his previous works 😉.</p>
<p>Thanks again to my friend Eliot for providing me with an advanced copy of your book as I thoroughly enjoyed it.

			 <p>Another trip around the sun for me as I flip my internal digits to <strong>41</strong>! As I am sitting down in these morning hours, hoping the kids will sleep in longer as they are on Spring Break, I am actually struggling what to write. It isn’t that I don’t know what to write but there was actually a lot of things that happened and I know I won’t capture them all or well enough in this entry. I am still working from home for the most part which is a blessing some days and a curse other times.</p>
<p>However, using past entries as a guide I will follow up on some things I alluded to last year and just talk about other things.</p>
<p>Year two with the RV was much like the first but a little less camping this year as we didn’t know what to expect with kids camps and stuff coming back. We never made it on a real long roadtrip but we visited a couple new places and old ones. I will say even though it is a chore getting the rig ready and cleaned out it seems like once we are at a place everyone enjoyed their time.</p>

<em>Lainey Lou the Doodle loves camping and her favorite camp chair&hellip; Sorry humans!</em></p>
<p>It was my 40th this past year I had some big things planned in the area of running&hellip;. The good thing is I did complete the <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/10/04/twin-cities-marathon.html">Twin Cities Marathon</a> that I did 20 years ago that day which was just a fun accomplishment in my mind.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/924e8a2dbb.jpg" alt=""><br>
<em>My crew really supported me the whole way with cheers.. I loved it!</em></p>
<p>However, the second thing I had up my sleeves didn’t pan out which might have been for the best. I would have had limited time in between each event so it might have made that Marathon extra hard. However, I decided to embark on my own adventure of a 4x4x40 which I then decided to complete the entire <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/21/xx-recap.html">4x4x48</a> (which involves running 4 miles ever 4 hours for 48 hours).</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/c28aac39d4.jpg" alt=""><br>
<em>Doing a 4x4x48 means sometimes you find yourself running at night in the snow/rain. It’s fun right?</em></p>
<p>It was one of those fun accomplishments that I was doing for myself and no one knew but me so that made it all the more fun. Kind of like when I ran a <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/09/30/k-a-day.html">5k a day for 365 days</a> as no one really knew much about it till the end. It wasn’t that I was hiding it but it was something that I wanted to prove to myself just like the 4x4x48. I am not really sure what this year will bring as I haven’t signed up for anything but I keep plugging along. If anything I am going to keep exploring as a good thing about being able to run further from my house is I find new places to explore.</p>

<em>Following some new to me paths in the Riley Creek Conservation Area</em></p>
<p>As I looking forward to this next year, I am looking forward to traveling again. We have a couple trips in the works for the summer that should be really fun. One with the RV and the other just flying somewhere. As a family we haven’t flew anywhere for such a long time. Additionally, I need to work some more on my “Project Shed” to get it in a better place to work before summer when the kids are at home every day.</p>
<p>I don’t think I did much around “Learning” this past year and for the life of me I am not sure what I was going to do. I guess silly as it is I learned (re-learned) how to be a longer distance runner but I don’t think that is what I was thinking. This year I am still going to focus on other aspects of <strong>“Embracing”</strong> which has been kind of an ongoing one but more around Embracing moments. I think being kind of locked up for the last two years (which it was good to be safe) has led me to not be as outgoing as I was and I know that needs to change slightly. I think there should be some easy wins here but just need to make the <em>time</em> and <strong>commitment</strong> to do it. Probably part putting myself out there again after all this time at home 😁.</p>

			 <p>Wow! All four games over the weekend were down to the wire last second buzzer beater games! The point differential in total was 8 (2,2,3,1 in that order). Proud of their team for not giving up as most of the games we came back from 8-10 points down but they played tough and didn’t give up. I am pretty sure all of us adults aged a bit more after those games.</p>
<p>My wife and I couldn’t attend the final 2 games on Sunday as we were at a Dance Competition for our two girls. A big thanks to to Papa Walker (my Dad) for being our in-person cheer squad while we watched via livestream from the girls’ dance competition. <em>(Apologies to the dancers on stage as our group let out an audible cheer at the buzzer beating victory!!! 🙉)</em></p>

<p>What a great way to end the season and it is sad that the season has now come to an end. It has been fun watching these boys play together. They had a very successful season (28-12) despite all the sicknesses, and injuries. As I was the official / unofficial stat keeper here are some interesting facts.</p>
<ul>
<li>1st Place in 3 tournaments</li>
<li>2nd Place in 2 tournaments</li>
<li>3rd Place in 1 tournaments</li>
<li>40% shooting percentage vs opponents 35%</li>
<li>One tournament they only had 5 kids to play (no subs) and only lost one game</li>
<li>Out of the 40 games only two kids were at all of them (one being my son)</li>
</ul>

			 <p>I have been collecting this data and been reading articles for some time about the discrepancies in my <strong>Apple Watch 6 vs my Garmin fēnix 5x</strong>. However, I have not finished all of that yet and felt compelled to post this quickly as I ran across a very puzzling issue today that I am not even really sure where to start but this is how it went.</p>
<p>On my run today I started both watches at the same time as always waiting for the Apple Watch to do it’s 3 second countdown and then I hit start on my Garmin. Today was colder out so I had a jacket over both watches so to that point I only looked once at both watches to see how the time was as I knew I needed to make a loop (or thought I did) because I wasn’t going to hit the mileage I was shooting for. However, the Apple Watch was back at the main screen and not in the Workout screen. This is only irritating as I had to type in my pin to get into the watch. I thought for sure then it must have stopped timing but this had also happened earlier in the week and once I clicked back into the Workout app I could see the time was still ticking away. I did the same thing today and glanced that it was still running but didn’t look close enough to know what the time said or anything.</p>
<p>Fast forward 1 more mile and I was at the end of my run and I stopped my Garmin first and then went to my wrist and stopped the Apple Watch as I always do. However, looking at the activity summaries I noticed the Apple Watch said I only ran a fraction of the time and distance I knew I was at.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/ea3d6c2048.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Now I have had some discrepancies before now but never such a big one</em></p>
<p>Knowing that didn’t seem right I dug into the details of the Apple Watch the GPS shows me stopping this half way through the run 🤔. I would say oh it must have just shut off but I know with 1 mile to go I looked at it and the time was ticking away so if anything where was that portion of time.</p>
<h3 id="i-gotta-have-the-details">I gotta have the details&hellip;</h3>
<p>Now as a person running with two watches I get I am a little strange but this was even more boggling than the research I have been looking into on just GPS accuracy for each watch. So I looked at some more of the details and found a couple interesting points.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/536c970837.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Garmin fēnix 5x</em></p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/0a42211841.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Apple Watch 6</em></p>
<p>You can see that both the Garmin and Apple Watch have the same start and stop times so I was correct at seeing the time clicking away when I had to re-enter my pin with 1 mile to go. However, that only goes to being more odd as the Apple Watch says the total time was 21:18 (head scratcher I know). Also, it says it didn’t have enough data for my Heart Rate. Something wasn’t working right the whole time because I would think even for a 2.5 mile run that would give it enough and I wear the watch pretty snug so it isn’t like it bounces around when I run. I guess Apple didn’t think I my <em>”effort”</em> was enough to be recorded for at least the last 3.7 miles but really the whole thing for HR perspective.</p>
<p>Hopefully, I will get to finishing my post around the GPS accuracy at some point but it probably won’t be any silver bullet as shockingly there is a lot of information but maybe only a couple good explanations. Until then I will hold off my true thoughts on both I will keep wearing them 😆. ⌚️ ⌚️</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I am not completely there yet but it seems a lot of my other projects as of lately have revolved around this idea of organizing things&hellip;</p>
<p>This probably started back in early January when I went down the rabbit hole of getting all my old DVDs on a computer to use with Plex as a way to free up some shelf space in the basement. I don’t remember the last time we have used any of those DVDs except a very small handful we take along in the RV. However, since putting them all on the computer, I think we have watched 10 movies off there so far. The next step in this process was getting a better handle on our Picture organization too, it aligned nicely with the first project because we had to get more HD space and in that purchase, we got a <em>new</em> computer so everything needed to be transferred from the old drive. With the new computer, the nice advantage is I have been able to remotely log into it and it is fast enough that I could look through old stuff and organize other things to fit with the process we use now. In fact, our picture process has even changed since I first had thought about it so maybe I will expand on that at another time.</p>
<p>Online organization, this I have written about before but I have really abandoned using my old blog / Instagram / Twitter and have doubled down on Mico.blog. I am happy with this change as I like everything in one place but I do find at times I might be over clutter the M.b timeline when I do some multiple posts from a weekend adventure. I like to toss a photo up to capture moments which is why a while back I mostly only used Instagram. I am still using it today but now I only use the app to follow some friends of mine that don’t really post anywhere else.</p>
<p>The next endeavor might take me a little longer to get done but I want to find the right tool or process to help me get more organized or stay organized. The issue is that I have realized a lack of organization in my life over the last year but probably has been a little longer than that. I hate to admit it, maybe it is an easy excuse but I think it has something to do with working from home and without having that separation and maybe a dedicated office space for non-work tasks, stuff has been blended together and I have not found a good way to reconcile all of it. There is also a lot of other things that have changed in my process over this time as well. I moved away from Evernote, which kept everything, to OneNote for some information and Day One for others. Additionally, once I completely ditched all my Android devices for iOS in 2021 (wow big purchase year), I then moved a little bit from OneNote into using more Apple Notes. So my storage of things is pretty fragmented right now as well and I think that is causing me panic as I don’t have a great system at this time.</p>
<p><strong><em>More to come&hellip;</em></strong></p>

			 <p>I spent more time that I like to admit thinking about using a Read it Later service I ran across called <a href="https://www.wallabag.it/en">Wallabag</a> only to on a wim sign up for a trial subscription. However, I never got an email to log into it which was super frustrating and then I was about ready to just setup the service on my own server as that is an option. However, I wanted to trial their service and who know maybe I would have just paid for it as it wasn’t that expensive. Long story short, I realized not recieving the email was 100z5 my fault because when I moved a domain over to Porkbun I didn’t setup the email forwarding right 🤦‍♂️. After getting that fixed, I decided to try to login to Wallabag again and see what this Read it Later service was all about.</p>
<p>Honestly, in the 2 min I used it and set up the Chrome Extension I had this feeling that I didn’t want it and probably would not use it anyways 😁. I think I realized again that anything I would stick in the <em>Read it Later</em> tool I would <strong>NEVER</strong> read later. It would just be a place of notes and I already have enough apps and tools that do that.</p>
<p>The closest I have come to using a Read It Later service on a more frequent basis was when I piped in RSS feeds directly to them and that was where I would just go read everything. My only issue with that was it wasn’t easy to just clear it out and declare RSS bankruptcy (which I do from time to time). Also, it came back to what would I do after I read an article do I archive it or delete it? I never went back and looked at prior saved articles and part of that is if I really wanted to remember something or retain something from what I read I would probably put it in a notes app.</p>
<p>So, after checking out another Read it Later service I am still back to not using a Read it Later service and I am ok with that. I did really like the name of the service though, in fact it could have been catchy&hellip; <strong>Wallabag.it</strong></p>

			 <p>Well this is disappointing how different the Apple Watch tracked my run against my Garmin 🤔. I know the Garmin number is right too as I run this route pretty regularly. Even looking at the details of each I can’t tell where the Apple Watch might have gotten off.</p>

<p>Just a normal <a href="http://www.strava.com/activities/6688606301">run</a> until I had to help rescue this dog that escaped its owner. When I found the dog no one was in sight. After I finally got the dog to me the owner showed up from down the street. All is right again.</p>

			 <p>This is something I should have done years ago honestly. However, as I have been moving more stuff to the old computer I used to use for some of my most recent <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2022/01/21/down-the-rabbit.html">projects</a>. I realized that it was very slowwwww&hellip; In fact, slow enough that now with the new to me Mac Mini up and running I can finally connect to it remotely and go through all my old files and not get frustrated and walk away. Finally it will be more than just a dumping ground that I never wanted to touch and might have some real <strong>order</strong>. To be clear, the old one did a great job of just backing up what was on it and the HD connected to it but other than that trying to log in and do something was a huge pain.</p>
<p>A couple weeks back I got this idea and saw a great deal for a used Mac Mini Late 2014 2.6GHz Dual Core i5. I decided to consulting with my new go to tech person, who gave it a thumbs up in agreement so I pulled the trigger. Not sure if he was just trying to get me to buy more Apple devices or if he really believed it was going to be better for me🤷‍♂️. Either way, fast forward to earlier this week and it is fully setup and functioning. I am so happy with the setup and it takes up such a smaller footprint than the iMac 24-in early 2008, 2.8Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo 😱.</p>
<p>A big thanks again to <a href="https://burk.io">Jason Burk</a> for helping me figure out how to set all this stuff up in the best way possible. In fact right now I am connected to it on my iPad from my kids school analyzing some horrifying results of <a href="https://setapp.com/apps/gemini">Gemini</a> in the amount of duplicate photos I have <em>(note I am trying it out via Setapp)</em>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I am not sure how this happened but I have gone down what I will call the rabbit hole of projects lately by having too many and all of them are in flight right now. Each will be great when they are done and all serve different purposes. Here they are in somewhat a specific order of events:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Micro.blog</strong> - I got this idea finally to try making Micro.blog my home for all Posts, and Pictures. This involved rolling up my old Website and then importing my Instagram photos. Both of the projects are “Done” in theory. However, there is a lot more clean-up than I anticipated so this will be an ongoing project for a while. I thought I had the website import done and cleaned up but now that I am still working on the Instagram stuff I am finding more that did not come through due to the issues I outlined in that <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2022/01/05/all-in-on.html">post</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Plex.tv</strong> - I got this installed on an old Mac I have stashed away in the basement after hearing it come up from time to time in conversations from others. My first thought was to use it as an easier way to access Pictures and Videos I had stored on a central storage device in my house. We store all of our pictures and videos there (which is then backed up to Backblaze) but sometimes getting them back or finding them again is not as easy as it should be. File sharing is slow to display previews and standing in the laundry room to use the computer isn’t ideal either. So I have only added at this point the 2021 photo library we have as the scan on this old thing takes a while and I also need this computer to do other work <em>(see below)</em></li>
<li><strong>DVDs</strong> (Part 1) - I got this crazy idea to clean out this DVD shelf that has too many DVDs of which never get used but you can see it in the background of all my WebEx calls. I realized that I could just box them up and put them away but some of them I realized I don’t have digitally and now that my kids are getting older I might want to watch with them. Unfortunately, before I started to box any of these up my wife reminded me that we do use the DVDs sometimes when we go Camping since streaming is not an option. Sometimes it is nice to have some on hand as a backup when it rains. Hoping there was a way to figure this all out I was reminded of an article from fellow Micro.blog friend Jason Burk describing how he created the <a href="https://burk.io/2021/creating-the-golden-set">Golden Set</a> by converting his DVDs to MP4s. <strong>BINGO</strong> now I had a project. *Current status is after a couple trial and errors, I have done about 150 of our DVDs and I feel like I have a long way to go.</li>
<li><strong>DVDs</strong> (Part 2) - Due to some of the trial and errors of the first project I dug out an old computer I had gotten long ago. Come to find out it would be the perfect DVD machine but I realized that it did not have windows on it and that sent me down a path of digging through old CDs to find some sort of Windows CDs from past systems. I did find an old copy of Windows 8 which was working fine until I couldn’t seem to get any updates to fix the mouse drivers and whatnot. The solution was going to be to buy Windows 10 (which I wasn’t excited about) but I found out I was eligible for a free Windows 10 upgrade. That all worked well but it took some time to get to that point.</li>
<li><strong>Storage</strong> 🤦‍♂️&hellip; As you work through the above projects you can only guess this leads to the question of do you have enough storage for all of these DVDs that you are going to now make digital? The answer is NO.. No, I do not. However, this was going to be an issue before this project took off as a couple of months ago I realized my 4TB HD was getting within 100GB of reaching the end of its life. To me, that is too close. <em>I need to still figure this out in the meantime I had a 2TB removable drive that I am currently putting all the movies on after I pull them off the DVDs. However, I don’t want this to last too long as they are not getting backed up to Backblaze and that would be a pain to have to do it all over again.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Well hopefully some of these projects come to completion this week or throughout the next couple of weeks but I am sure they will drag on much longer than that.</p>

			 <p>Another step in migrating a lot of my stuff in one place has been completed. I wish I could say this was a super simple process that took an hour or less and was done. However, due to some <strong>user</strong> confusion, it took me more hours than I would like to add up. I was probably trying to do too many tasks at once but I ended up uploading a lot of duplicates which then required me to click into each Uploads page and Posts page and remove said duplicates 🤦‍♂️. Now in theory I would not have had to do this as it would only annoy anyone flipping through old posts but seeing how that for sure will be me it would annoy me and now seemed like the best time to clean it up before it really annoys me in the future <em>(future Eric better thank me)</em>.</p>
<p>Thinking back there are probably two things I should have done differently or paid closer attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Really understand what and how things were going to get pulled over to Micro.blog. I know it was said many times in what I had read on the post about it but I kind of forgot that I had a bunch of Instagram posts where I had 10 pictures in each. They were when we were traveling and I did a daily recap of our days. So&hellip; that then created 10 M.b posts that really require clean up as it also didn&rsquo;t pull over the caption for one or any of the 10 pictures.</li>
<li>Do smaller bathes of photos and remember to clear the selection after it is uploaded. I think this is where my duplicates came into place. I think I would start selecting the next batch before the first finished. So when I then clicked Import the next time some were duplicated.</li>
<li>Hashtags - Wow this seems like a fun idea when you are using Instagram but it is really a pain when you import all of them and you have a ton of hashtags for a photo. Now I should say, it looked fine but I just couldn’t live with myself having the hashtags that were of really no use to me in my new setup. This is one of those times I wish I could just do a find an replace. 😆</li>
<li>Emoji’s - Not sure why but theses didn’t really come though all the time. Some many times they were garbled. I guess it would have been good again to check this first but I think in my earlier or later times on Instagram I didn’t use them as much as I did at one time.</li>
</ul>
<p>I should say even though I had some frustration cleaning up the issues from the import. I don&rsquo;t really blame the program as it was really my own mistake in not fully paying attention or understanding.</p>
<p>One interesting thing I did find when going back though and cleaning up the pictures, there was a time that I posted some of the same things to my old blog as I did Instagram. As of now I kept them both there. I know I need to do some more cleanup so when that time comes I might remove some of them.</p>
<p><strong>Next up&hellip;</strong> I don’t know if there is much else left to bring into M.b. I have some other older sites that my wife and I used when we went to Peru and then when our son was born 6 weeks early. Those two were merged many years ago and then it was more or less a family site that we kept updating with pictures of the kids. However, each year that goes by we use it less and less and I am pretty sure we didn’t use it at all last year. If I decided to bring it in, I think it would only be parts and I would need to go back and make sure all is fixed before I do that as I don’t want to cause more problems for myself 😆.</p>

			 <p>I can’t say for sure this will be my final solution but it has made sense so far. A little while ago that I wanted to give this a try as I don’t like having too many different places on the internet to hold where my stuff is. I had been stuck for a while thinking of a new domain name and in the meantime I bought about 10 (yikes!). Maybe I will point some of them to some specific stuff on Micro.blog but my main one now for this domain is going to just be <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog">EricMWalk.blog</a>. I think I will make a simple static site that my EricMWalk.com can be pointed to and there I can point people to other projects I have worked on. However, right now it just goes to my old WordPress blog so still need to get that changed.</p>
<p>So I finally did it and moved all of my old posts from my self hosted WordPress blog to Micro.blog so I would have finally one source of information <em>(well not exactly more on that later)</em>. Overall the import process in Micro.blog worked flawlessly except, I did find some issues but they were self inflicted for many reasons. The one I assumed I would run into was any links I had in my posts to other posts on my site which would not get updated correctly. I was right on that but luckily I didn’t have too many posts with that issue and I could correct that problem somewhat quickly by doing a search in the Micro.blog post section for my old site name. However, the two bigger unknowns to me that I probably should have expected but didn’t think about were having too many tags and that pictures didn’t import.</p>
<p>Tags - This was nightmare. I guess though the years on WordPress I got very Tag happy as it didn’t seem hard to just add them as you went and honestly I probably didn’t use them too much but to find related things or maybe others did. However, all of them got imported into Micro.blog and I quickly realized that my one off tags were very messy. So I went though and painfully deleted as many as I could. I still have more than I like but it was a good start to see how I can use tags going forward. I think the interesting thing for tags in Micro.blog is that they are their own feeds so I might do something with that at some point.</p>
<p>Pictures <em>(Root Cause - Old Domain Names 🤦‍♂️)</em> - This is a problem of having various domain names over the years. Micro.blog did an exactly what it was suppose to do and did an excellent job importing the photos to Micro.blog when it could “find” the photos. However, since some of the domains I don’t have anymore I had broken links on my WordPress site that I had not really realized so Micro.blog couldn’t find the photo to import. I am not sure if there is a quicker way to fix it on the Micro.blog side of things but honestly if I would have maybe thought about this before I exported everything I more than likely could have cleaned it up to make it work more seamlessly.</p>
<p>Other than those two minor hiccups I am glad to have gone full in on Micro.blog and with that I am hoping to be posting more photos, thoughts, and other things I find interesting all in one spot.</p>
<h4 id="next-up">Next up&hellip;</h4>
<p>Since I have not been using Facebook (forever really), and Instagram has been less and less. I stoped really posting to Facebook specifically a long time ago and just did instagram and my WordPress blog but since the beginning of 2021 I have been really using Micro.blog to post the quick photos I would have done there. So next up I am thinking of pulling all of my historic Instagram posts to Micro.blog after I ran across this <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/import-from-instagram/77">help post</a>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Two weeks ago I decided to set off on completing a <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/01/xx-running-challenge.html">4x4x40</a> as part of some crazy ideas for my 40th birthday year. However, after I reached the 40 miles I felt like I really needed to continue as I figured at that point I might never do this again and get so close to hitting the real number and completing a 4x4x48 (run 4 miles every 4 hours for 48 hours). Maybe it helped that I was a bit sleep deprived at the time and not thinking clearly as I figured what was two more 4 mile runs at that point.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/d0d7eda4b0.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Since I posted after each of my runs with a short photo, time, and thought I will not rehash all of them. I don’t want to make light of this challenge as I think it was hard but the miles themselves weren’t the worst for me. Some of that could have been that I didn’t really have a pace per mile in mind. I obviously wasn’t going to try to run the fastest 4 miles I could every time. However, in my mind, I wanted to keep all of my averages per run under 9 min/miles. The biggest struggle for me during this challenge was trying to fit it in during a normal working day. Due to the weather forecast and maybe my last-minute planning, as it was December, I did it during the middle of a workweek. So I scheduled it out earlier in the week and pretty much created an appointment for myself every 4 hrs. It worked great the first day but the second day some things came up at work so I had to shrink down one of my 3 hr blocks of <em>recovery</em> and extend other ones. I still was able to get the run in that 4 hr bock but I wasn’t as consistently on the hour as I was the first day of running. In a way, I am wondering if working both days helped me keep my focus away from running and how tired I might have been as I was doing things I needed to do during the day. Then in the evenings I still helped get the kids to activities and stuff.</p>
<p>Now obviously the lack of sleep is one thing but the worst time of runs for me was the 5am runs that I did. I think it is because after the late-night 1am run it always took me longer than anticipated to fall asleep. You would have thought I would have been tired enough to just get into the house and fall asleep. I am guessing that the kick of adrenaline that was in my body messed with allowing my brain to shut down at that time. So for both days by the time I would will myself to sleep and it would work I think I only got 1 hr before I would have to wake up at 5am to run. After that run, I would just start my day and didn’t try to get any more rest as my youngest gets on the bus at 7am.</p>
<p>In the end, I have never run so many miles in two days. It ended up being 48.9 miles due to one run when I put my trust in a running friend who lead me astray by an extra mile. Those two days were more mileage than I had completed any week during my marathon training this past year. It was an interesting challenge as it took careful planning as I still worked and helped with kid activities like a normal day. It was just I ran every 4 hrs 😁. The day after I was done I felt pretty wiped out from most likely lack of sleep and over-exercise. Fast forward two weeks later and I am back on track. Maybe I will do another one of these challenges someday but probably no time soon. At least for the rest of this year, it will be back to the normal scheduled running for me.<br>

			 <p>Earlier this year I had a plan to run 40 miles with a really good friend of mine through the mountains of Colorado. We thought it would be fun to run 40 miles since we both turned 40 this year. Not to mention suffering together and probably laughing along the way made it seem like a feat that could be pushed through to accomplishment. The timing was not going to be great for me as it was one month before my <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/10/04/twin-cities-marathon.html">Twin Cities Marathon</a> but I was game to do it as it sounded amazing. Honestly, I wasn’t even sure how to train for such a thing but I just said yes and he said he would work out the details. The bummer is around May he hurt his ankle and knew the run wouldn’t happen. I was bummed that it fell apart but it probably worked out since I hadn’t run a marathon for 20 years and I wasn’t sure what I was in for. I am sure it probably wouldn’t have been great to come in not feeling the best from a 40 mile run through the mountains no matter how long it took us.</p>
<p>Fast forward to about 1 month before I ran the marathon and I stumbled across this concept of running 4 miles every 4 hours for 48 hours. At the time I didn’t know anything about it but thought that had a nice ring to it. However, the whole 48 hrs didn’t mesh with my goal so I figured I would modify it slightly to fit as a <strong><em>4x4x40</em></strong> instead 😁.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4 miles every 4 hours for 40 hours since I am 40 this year</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That leads me up to now&hellip; After the <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/10/04/twin-cities-marathon.html">marathon</a>, I have been trying to take it easy and just running for pleasure but I feel like I have been missing something as I had hoped to do something else with this <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/03/24/forty.html">year 40</a>. After pondering this for the last month, I realized that if I am going to do it I need to do it before it gets too cold in the night to complete this task so I am going to start tonight (or today) and we will see how this goes.</p>
<p>I do know more about the real 4x4x48 challenge and the guy who created it. However, my goal still has not changed. I will probably write about it as I go mostly just to document it along the way so I apologize to anyone not interested in this disregard my posts for at least more than 40 hrs from the first. Then we will be back to our regularly scheduled posting.</p>
<p>I don’t have any main goals in mind if you are wondering. My goal is probably to do as many of these 4x4s that I can in hopes to get to 40 but that is a lot of mileage for me in a short amount of time. Also, I am not concerned about my pace either except hoping I don’t go too fast at any point as that could screw things up. Either way, this is going to be an interesting experiment no matter how many I get done so we will see how it goes!</p>
<p>A final note for those interested, I am still working and getting kids to school and activities. So I am kind of treating this as just some breaks throughout my day and that is another reason why this time lined up perfectly. In the perfect world, I would only be doing this 40hrs with no other responsibilities. 🤷‍♂️</p>

			 <p>Brecken has been begging us to go family bowling since he has started in this junior League every that plays every Saturday. With his new ball finally ready it seemed like the right time for a Sunday morning family fun. Can’t beat the prices at Tuttles for $2.50 per game so we got there early and had a late breakfast while we bowled for a couple hours. Everyone seemed to enjoy doing something different but I think the third game might have been a little too much. With our family of 5 it took us about 1 hr to bowl a game but everyone powered through even with some touch and go moments at some times 😁.</p>

I hadn’t thought much of it since I listened to the episode but all of a sudden over the last couple of days I realized things I was doing, researching, or even talking about have been reminding me of something from my youth.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/11aab6df29.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="trains-"><strong>Trains&hellip; 🚂</strong></h2>
<p>That is right, trains. I have always had this interest / fascination with trains which at some point also lead me to model trains when I was younger. I am not sure when it ever first started but it could have been a visit to the Henry Ford Museum as a kid, or watching trains go by the train tracks at the end of the street, or maybe from my walks home from school or when my friend and I would go exploring train bridges and walk along the tracks near our houses, or it could just be they are huge machines and as a kid that is really cool! I am not sure when my interest in trains finally led me to model trains but when that happened I remember being interested all over again as it was something I could purchase, build, and tinker with all the extra electronics.</p>
<p>Over the years, I stopped getting more model train stuff and boxed everything up when I went to college. After college, there was a brief time when I lived with my brother and I got really into it again and started buying engines and other parts as a local store was going out of business. However, once I moved away to Chicago that obsession stopped again. Once I moved back to Minnesota and we had younger kids I set up the track and got all the trains out a couple of times but even then that has now passed. They are now sitting in a box high up in the closet of our basement craft room. Maybe someday I will bring them down and set them up again.</p>

<p>One thing is for sure, anytime I find myself running on an old Rail Trail, crossing train tracks to get somewhere, visiting places with old train Depots, or even thinking about how I used to walk home from school. All of those experiences trigger memories of when I was younger.</p>

			 <p>Todays running adventure in the light snow fall was finding a new trail. Or that is what I thought I had stumbled upon… Come to find out I was wrong. So after jumping through the tall grass for a while I gave up and turned around. 🌨🏃🏻‍♂️</p>
<p>Do you see a trail?🤦‍♂️</p>

			 <p>Decided to follow a trail with 6 tunnels yesterday along the 3.4 mile <a href="https://onthegomap.com/s/t0pshhke">Bluff Creek Local Trail</a> in Chanhassen 🏃🏻‍♂️</p>

<p>W 78th St Tunnel <em>(the start of the trail)</em></p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/205384dc28.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Arboretum Blvd Tunnel <em>(It is really two tunnels as you can see the space in the center but really only one road so I am counting it as one)</em></p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/75ebf43d4e.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Coulter Blvd Tunnel</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/9b2552b300.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Twin Cities &amp; Western Railroad Tunnel</p>

<p>Lyman Blvd Tunnel</p>

<p>Bluff Creek Road Tunnel</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/06cf92e00a.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Then I actually found the end of the trail so I turned around and ran back to my car 😁. I had actually never run on this trail before so even though the map said it was going to end sometimes things aren’t updated that well and I was thinking it might have gone further. So it did surprise me when I came to the end and the path did not go further or connect up to anything else. I am guessing it is because if they wanted to keep extending it South they would have to figure out how to go over or under HWY-212.</p>
<p>Overall, it was really nice trail that was all asphalt so I might have to remember this one for next summer with the kids as the distance isn’t to crazy either.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong>: Since I didn’t post this yesterday as planned, I dug into some of the old Chanhassen park records and it seems like the Master Park / Trail plans from 2017 and 2018 assumed they would continue it further South. I wonder if once the construction of HWY-212 was completed they just abandoned the original plan or maybe didn’t leave a passage to get under it. I did notice that the HWY was on the original plans but based on what I know it wouldn’t have been completed at that time and was still a work in progress. Additionally, the details of their plan never really addressed how it was going to get past that HWY like other referenced markings on the plan to show an existing bridge or tunnel.</em></p>

			 <p>Back when I was a long time Fitbit user, I used to have a scale from them as well so all of my fitness information was in once place. In fact, from time to time I would keep track of foods I ate in the Fitbit app as well and it worked pretty well overall.</p>
<p>However, as time has passed I got <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/10/08/goodbye-fitbit.html">frustrated with Fitbit</a> and it’s lack of durability from my point of view and move to a Garmin. I still used my Fitbit scale until it broke not long after but also my wife had bought one of those <a href="myshapa.com">Shapa scales</a> that was about the worst type of scale out there. Sorry, I am sure it works for some people but for me I could care less what color I had I just wanted to know my actual weight in lbs 😆. I did figure out how I could get a number by having the information shared with Google Fit and then I could just manually put it into my Garmin Connect app. I hate to say I did that for longer than I would like to have admitted before I got tired of doing the manual part and just donated the scale as no one else was using the piece of garbage anyways.</p>
<p>That brings me to today as I would like to keep track of my weight again as well as try to track my calorie intake. I am trying to figure out the best route to take here and am open to suggestions. Ideally, I would like a single app that could pull all of this information together as a one stop shop. I know I could buy a normal scale and enter the information manually but for me I want to set a routine of standing on the scale and not make notes to myself to record it in a system. I just want it to be automatic! Kind of like the Fitbit did for me before but since I don’t have a Fitbit watch that seems kind of silly for that and I have found nothing plays super nice with Garmin Connect. Ideally, it would be something that can send data to or pull information from Garmin Connect or Apple Health.</p>
<p><em>Any suggestions send them my way please!</em></p>

			 <p>I really can’t believe that I found my Apple Pencil late yesterday. As I kept thinking about it I was trying to remember what was around me at the table where I was working the day before. The problem is everything had gotten moved around as well as the kids dumped all of their Halloween candy out to sort through so I had to think about what was there the day before. I looked all over the floor and around the area thinking maybe it rolled off or got attached to the metal under the table or on the chairs. Also, we have a new coffee bar that has metal doors on it so I thought maybe it attached itself to that. Finally, while looking at that I saw the new black metal baskets my wife bought for us and I remembered how my daughter got some white ones as well. So I walked back to her room and sure enough as you can see it attached itself to the metal white basket that she showed me before she moved it back to her room. I am still surprised that I found it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>It has been so long since I have actually logged into and looked around at my WordPress powered <a href="https://upnorth.blog">UpNorth.blog</a> site that I realized so much stuff is outdated.</p>
<p>Right now I push all the content from Micro.blog there as it was how I set it up a year ago and I actually don’t mind the process flow. Nothing that gets pushed over there is published to the front page unless I want it to be and have to log in to make it happen. Otherwise all of these posts are kind of hidden in the background. I know if you really wanted to find it you could but you might have to dig a little or know what to search for. There has only been a couple times in the past year that I have taken a post I published on Micro.blog and made sure it hit the main page of that site.</p>
<p>As I keep looking at the couple of site pages I have, I found my about page hadn’t been updated for 4 years as it talked about some work I did with a different non-profit. Also, I realized I had a newsletter subscribe and archive link there that I haven’t even sent anything out since 3 years ago as well.</p>
<p>I guess I am trying to figure out the purpose of this site as anything I want to share or post I publish to my Micro.blog site. I don’t really need a professional site of any kind so it is almost a backup of my Micro.blog which isn’t the end of the world but I have been thinking about changing things up again.</p>
<p>Uh oh&hellip; 😁</p>

			 <p>I believe today marks my one year of using Micro blog or at least based on my post from a year ago <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2020/10/13/new-day-new.html">today</a> (my one year being a paid member is coming up). However, with that said I now see my <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/on-this-day/">On this Day</a> page doesn’t work 😒 (add that to my list to look into another time).</p>
<p>Thinking back, I can’t believe it took me so long to find this platform or maybe I saw it and didn’t think to use it.</p>
<p>Either way I have enjoyed the past year learning about what is possible and in some places figuring out a work around or how it can work for me. Honestly, the best part of Micro.blog is the community and acquaintances that I have made through this platform. It kind of fits with what I have always looked for when blogging. I do it mostly for myself but if someone else reads it and finds it interesting then great. Also, since it is ingrained into everything else on Micro.Blog then I can find others that are like minded and interested in similar topics.</p>
<p>Even after a year of using Micro.blog I am still not entirely sure what my setup is going to look like but for now it is working and the linking I have done between my older <a href="https://upnorth.blog">WordPress</a> blog works.</p>

			 <p>Well after all the build up for the past 9 months the race is done and I am happy with my own results. After, what has been a 20 year hiatus <em>(more on that below)</em> I was glad to conquer this one in much more style, less pain, and a time I had not planned for 😁. As I have told most people who ask me, it is amazing what some real training does when preparing for a marathon.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/3380c7fa50.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Building up to race day I was asked what time or pace I was shooting for and in reality I didn’t have much thought. Well there was some thoughts but honestly my goal was faster than 20 years ago time but more specifically I was shooting for under 4 hrs since I felt even being 20 years older I could bet that time of <a href="https://www.mtecresults.com/runner/show?rid=3083&amp;race=3588">4:15:17</a> by 15 min. Not only did I beat that time I crushed it by 35 minutes for a time of <strong><a href="https://www.mtecresults.com/runner/show?rid=2402&amp;race=12105">3:39:28</a></strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/924e8a2dbb.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Also, I can’t thank my family enough for coming out to support me as it was great seeing people I knew from time to time throughout the day.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/b80a8a665b.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Not to mention my champion wife who was trucking around the Twin Cities to various points even though she didn’t know the roads very well while with her was 3 kids of which some expired at my 2 hr mark.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/e95deeb0dc.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>She was there for the first one 20 years ago so it was great to have her and the rest of my cheering section. Also, for the last push of 6 miles I saw my uncle on the sidelines saying “looks like you got this one” which was a great confidence booster in the middle of the 3 mile uphill climb.</p>

##2001 Race Background##
20 years ago on a whim I signed up for the 2001 Twin Cities Marathon sometime after I had just turned 20. I am not really sure what I was thinking but I believe in a way it was because I had not keep up running much from my High School days and missed it. I also thought I would share in the punishment and poor college student me signed my brother up (who was working at the time) as well since he lived in Minneapolis. I figured what was he going to do if I signed him up for it, not show up?</p>
<p>I jumped right into some training plan I am sure I found on the internet at the time and was following it religiously throughout that summer as I stayed up at school and all my friends went home. However, when the training plan started to tick up miles school was back in session and my training fell off the radar. I don’t even think I ran anything of value or consistency the month before the race. Talk about coming in cold. In fact, the longest I had run before that 2001 Marathon was 13 miles.</p>
<p>Let’s just say the day turned out as you would have expected, the adrenaline and excitement pushed me though probably 17 miles worth. Then I gritted it out for another 3 that I can’t remember. The last 6.2 miles were torchure and I think most of it has escaped me. From what I remember it was a lot of walking for that last 6.2 miles and seems right as up to that point I was tracking time well and then it took me one and fifteen minutes to complete that last 6.2 miles. I remember finally realizing that I as only 1 mile from the finish and I think that is when I started to somewhat run again knowing the end was finally in sight. The best part of that race was that I crossed the finish line with my uncle and to this day we all still joke how I touched the finish line first.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/2a678fda02.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>However, in reality when I was dying on those last miles at some point he passed me up and I caught back up to him in the final stretch. Since that time but probably not right after I kept telling myself that if I was ever going to run another one and I did want to I wanted to make sure I trained for it much better than before. Don’t get me wrong it wasn’t that the time was overly horrible but I knew I could have done better so it was my goal.</p>

			 <p>Earlier this week where I live a runner, <a href="https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-news/eden-prairie-man-found-dead-was-training-for-the-chicago-marathon">Mike Elhard</a>, who was going out on a 20 mile training run for the Chicago Marathon went missing on Monday morning. He wasn’t running at night or even during really hot weather as it was 10am and the day was actually cooler than normal. Once they realized he was missing the local police and residences searched that late afternoon and into the evening on roads and paths near his house and routes he frequently took. Unfortunately, he was found dead Tuesday just off a sidewalk in some brush. The police said there was no signs of foul play but nothing else has been released.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/c33ec0c365.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>As I was running yesterday, I couldn’t shake the thought out of my mind as I too am a runner mostly running by myself during the week. I am fortunate enough that my longer runs I have been running with a friend in the area.</p>
<p>Even though I never knew Mike, I want to think we might have crossed paths at some point along the trails and probably gave a nod, or wave or maybe just smiled at each other.</p>
<p>Mike was only 39 and probably in pretty good shape seeing how he was going to run a Marathon in a couple weeks as well and was out on his 20 mile long run. I am only 40 and it really puts things in perspective how short life can be sometimes. Rest In Peace fellow runner.</p>

			 <p>Honestly, I am not very good at keeping in touch with people. This could really be anyone, friends, old co-workers, newer acquaintances. For some reason, I always have great intentions of reaching out but just never feel it is the right time to reach out and say I will later.</p>
<p>I was reminded of this the other day while running and I passed an old co-worker and friend of mine walking with his wife. I said hi quick but since I was running with another guy I didn&rsquo;t stop to talk. After I got done I was reminded that I have been meaning to reach out to this guy for a long time and every time I would think about it I would find about 100x other things to accomplish. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong it has nothing to do with the other guy because I do this all of the time. It is just one of those tasks that always get buried for me thinking I will find a better time to reach out or I will do it right after work.</p>
<p>I guess you could say it is a good thing I am aware of it 🤷‍♂️. However, I am going to try to be better and see about setting time aside for starters each week to reconnect with some people whom I haven&rsquo;t but have been meaning to for a while. We all get busy from time to time and with kids thrown into the mix it gets even worse. However, there is always time to keep connections flowing instead of dead ends.</p>

			 <p>I had been an Android user for as long as I can remember and have always enjoyed the phones and software. Maybe I should caveat that last statement with I have had a bunch of iPhones too but at one point I was drawn more to Android and then I really had not looked back and honestly kind of refused to for no real reason. However, after being nagged by my family I broke down in May of this year to get the iPhone mini.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/48b69212e0.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>My original goal was to use the iPhone mini as my main phone for texts (iMessages specifically) but continue to keep my Galaxy S-21 as it took amazing photos and videos. I figured I would run with the Galaxy and use it when we went on family trips. However, I quickly remembered I did not like the two phone life after 2 weeks and ended up selling the Galaxy S-21 as it was still pretty new and there was some value I could get out of selling it. I think one of the big things for me that made this switch easy was the size of the iPhone mini, even though my Galaxy was not large the iPhone mini was the perfect size as I didn’t need a huge screen that was not the purpose of the phone for me.</p>
<p>After a month of using the iPhone mini with my Galaxy Tab S7 (with a keyboard of course), I started to get the itch of having the devices sync together better so that got me looking at the iPads. The original reason I got the Galaxy Tab was to use it as a replacement for paper to take handwritten notes at work. I could link up to my companies Office 365 and use OneNote which wasn’t all that bad and I liked having the notes on my tablet and computer synced (my work only had and still has Windows computers). The other reason I got the Galaxy Tab was to be able to have a more personal device when traveling for work and pre-pandemic I traveled quite a bit so it was nice to have a device of my own to do things on that wasn’t my work computer. So fast forward to the end of July it kind of seemed like a no-brainer to get an iPad as it could do what my Android tablet could do and it would sync better with my phone. So I broke down and bought an iPad Pro 11” with Magic Keyboard for iPad and the Apple Pencil 2.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/4f97487afa.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Now if only I could use a Mac for work instead of this clunky Dell Windows machine I would be happier but it is ok. With the iPad Pro 11”, since I got the keyboard, I mostly just carry that around to use when I am not working on work stuff in the house. I will give Apple a lot of credit here on the keyboard as they really did it right with how the keyboard works as it can be propped up by itself without needing to be set on a desk.</p>
<p>I feel like now with my new devices I need to go back and listen to all the Podcasts that I have in the past 4 years that talk about iOS apps as I always listened to them but a lot of the time since there was not an Android version I just forgot about them.</p>
<p><em>Next up finding new apps 😁..</em></p>

			 <p>Sometimes you have to <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/02/09/back-to-running.html">start over</a> at ground zero. Well technically I am probably not at ground zero this time because I only had four days off in a row.</p>
<p>This week however I have been getting back into running or restart my running has been a struggle. I have found it much more difficult that I would have thought based on the amount of mileage I typically run and how often I had been running each week. However, I am still probably not 100% better from my Achilles heel pain (or this is what my PT friends tell me I have). In addition, the heat and humidity earlier this week has not helped in my attempts to ease back into running. I restarted this week doing shorter than normal runs but since my only time was late afternoon I was battling getting back at it during the hottest times of day.</p>
<p>I have <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/07/08/it-is-official.html"><strong>45 days</strong></a> left until the Twin Cities Marathon &hellip; Right now my goal is to not get injured more and get my comfort level back up when running longer miles.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/07/08/i-hte-running.html">📚 I H💛TE RUNNING AND YOU CAN TOO by Brendan Leonard</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/07/08/i-hte-running.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-07-08 08:32:00 -0500">Jul 8, 2021</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>If you are looking for a great motivational book to keep you going in whatever you are trying to do look no further. If you are looking for a book about how to run then this might not be what you are looking for but you should pick this one up as well to give you some laughs along your running journey.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The great part about this book is that it is all about the Running journey and exploring why people run and the motivation behind it. By using Brendan&rsquo;s and others' relatable running stories it frames up challenges all of us face to just get motivated to do things in life. There are always obstacles in the way, better things to do, or thinking we are too busy to do something. As a &ldquo;runner&rdquo; myself, I can personally relate to the specific stories of running as no matter how much I love running, being outdoors, It is much better to have the run done and behind me as I too am someone that struggles most of the time to just get out the door.  Specific to running, everyone has their own story and reasons why they run and Brendan also explores that as part of the book.</p>
<p><a href="https://semi-rad.com/2021/03/people-who-get-to-decide-what-the-point-of-all-your-running-is/"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Now I am a fan of Brendan Leonard fan of his work from his site <a href="https://semi-rad.com">Semi-Rad</a>, and this book did not disappoint. That being said, I have seen some of these graphs before but the rest of the story and context is short, witty, and perfectly sized for most of us to get through in a timely manor.</p>
<p>One of my favorite parts of the book is when he is talking about what he calls the &ldquo;invisible work&rdquo; which in the context of the book is all of the miles and hours you put in before a race or event. In fact, for someone like myself who is planning on running a <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/07/08/it-is-official.html">Marathon</a> later this year, I have already run about 37 marathons with the number of miles I have put in so far.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Inspiration is for amateurs. The rest of us just show up and get to work. - Chuck Close</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall, I couldn&rsquo;t recommend this book more but honestly don&rsquo;t just take my word for it and pick up a <a href="https://semi-rad.com/books/">copy from the links on his website</a>. The best thing is it is a smaller-sized book so you can carry it with you on all of your adventures (well maybe not while running) so you can refer to the helpful motivational kick in the butt that is needed from time to time while doing anything. Honestly, I wish I had this book a couple of years back when I was content with just running a <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/09/30/k-a-day.html">5k a day</a> as some days were harder to get motivated than others. As I am now running longer miles with slightly less frequency, I feel like this book helps keep me motivated to get out there.</p>

			 <p>Pretty sure I was chased by the same bird that followed me a couple of weeks <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/06/18/i-was-followed.html">back</a>. This time however it was less in a fun way of circling me and more of an attacking / intimidating me. I am guessing the bird has a nest that is close to this boardwalk path since it seemed quite upset with me after I ran by a specific bush that is really close to the path. I remember seeing it flying by me and then instantly circled and flew after me chirping along the way. I looked back probably 3 different times and it was no more than 5 feet from me in the air acting like it would like to peck me in the head. After I finally got away and realized it wasn&rsquo;t following me I snapped this picture.</p>

			 <p>This little issue sucked away a good chunk of time for me yesterday when all of a sudden the lights where I work shut off. Problem was some power was still flowing through to the tracks and even to the light fixtures but when I put a bulb in the fixtures nothing and the. I realized power would drop on other open light fixtures. That is when what I was hoping was a quick fix turned into a longer project as I had to take the whole track lighting down to get to the main wiring. That is when I found this gem 🤦‍♂️</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Yep, older wiring in houses are an adventure indeed.</p>
<p>Luckily, I have tackled something like this before as I have replaced out fixtures and outlets so I had all the supplies I needed to hopefully not have it happen again. All fixed now and track lighting is working perfectly again. 💡👨‍🔧</p>

It doesn&rsquo;t take me long to take a quick picture and put my phone away but to my surprise as i kept running there were some deer watching me. In fact, looking back at my photo now I can spot one but I didnt see it tell after I started up again.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><em><strong>Forty</strong></em>… Yep, you read that right I hit the big <strong>4-0</strong> this year which besides the number I don’t feel much different today.</p>
<p>Looking back over the past year all I can say it has been a strange one indeed. I have always wanted the chance to work from home and boy did I get it. In the past year, I have only gone to the office three times and taken one business trip (which was just a month ago to the middle of nowhere Indiana).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However, some good things came out of last year as the whole family spent a lot more time together than typically. We purchased a Camper in July of last year and after getting it we found a way to use that thing almost every weekend until we put it in storage for the winter. We had been thinking of buying a camper for a while so once we saw that we probably wouldn’t be traveling like our normal road trips that we had been thinking about it seemed like no better time than to pull the trigger on the RV. I won’t say every trip was magical with the family but overall everyone enjoyed it and enjoyed exploring the various State Parks in our area. It was a good way for us to get away from our house and all the electronics that are inside of it. However, April and I did work on some of our camping adventures. We figured since we were both working remotely and if we didn’t mind having to be creative to connect to the internet it would be great to squeeze a couple more days on the front and back end of weekend trips.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Working from home has been interesting (ok bad sometimes) but in other ways good. It is hard to really slice and dice my complete thoughts on this but I think simply put I enjoy being able to get my kids on and off the bus each day. I appreciate this school year as opposed to last where they were learning from home full time as I am not a great teacher myself and those days it was harder to focus on my work. However, being honest my wife took the brunt of the teaching and keeping the kids on task and I am forever grateful for her always keeping the family in order. The hardest thing for kids I think to understand when they would have days off and mom and dad are working from home is they are not sure why we won’t play with them NOW. As smart as all my kids are, they are still shocked when they have a no school day and I still have to work. I think the kids believe that we should all be on the same schedule.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One of the benefits I have really been reaping this year working from home is Running. I used to be a morning runner by default because I wanted to get it done before I went to work each day. I knew myself and if I didn’t do it then, then I might not do it at all. This past year things have changed, I not only didn’t want to wake anyone up in the morning but I also realized that I could avoid running in the dark often as I could duck out for an hour during the middle of the day.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Embracing was the theme of last year and I feel like that was accomplished with how our family got to spend more time together doing different things and how more recently I have doubled down in focusing on my running personally. I came in strong last year thinking about running a Marathon but then when the pandemic hit and everything got canceled it only took me a month later to start lagging in my motivation to keep running a bunch of miles. However, I did get a spark of new hope after we got the camper again as we were visiting all of these cool State Parks that had miles of trails. So I made sure that every park I tried to explore as much as I could by either hiking with the family or just going out for a run at some point during our stay.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes a change of scenery is a great motivation to get out there and explore (or run).</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Since the start of January, I have decided to take a different approach to my running by really trying to get more longer runs weekly. Previously, I would have probably only run one or two 6.2 mile runs a week and that was about all I could handle with other 3.1 mile runs sprinkled in. Right now I have a goal of running the Twin Cities Marathon later this year as it has been exactly 20 years since I have run a marathon (that one in fact). I have something else up my sleeve as well but still working on the execution to make sure it goes through. If so it will be fun for sure and make that Marathon extra hard with the little rest between the events. I have been pleased with my efforts so far but the road is still long ahead. If anything, I have continued to build on longer runs throughout the week, and as a benefit, I have been able to explore a lot of new places around my house by going outside what was a 3.1 mile radius.</p>
<p>As things are ever-changing in the world today with the virus and vaccine rollout, I am optimistic to see what this next year will be as I am rolling into another decade. As I still am thinking Embracing seems like another fitting theme, I will expand that as I would like to continue <strong>“Learning”</strong>. More on that topic but this is long enough and the kids are about ready to get off the bus ☺.</p>

			 <p>Last night I was looking for a place I ran in Germany when I was there on a work trip in 2015.

<p>As I logged back into Fitbit for the first time in a long time I was hit in the face again with how terrible their activity log and reporting is. Not to mention if you want your GPS data back and not a crummy CVS output of steps good luck!</p>
<p>Unforentually, my realization that I did not import my data from 2014-2016 into Strava or Garmin sent me down a rabbit hole of manual tasks by finding all my old runs in Fitbit to download. I am happy to say that task is done and I can thankfully (hopefully) never log into Fitbit again 😁.</p>

		<a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/02/23/goodbye-blogging-meetup.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-02-23 11:24:00 -0500">Feb 23, 2021</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>It has been <!-- raw HTML omitted -->5 years since<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the Blogging Meetup was started as it came about from a group of us that wanted to keep the conversation going after a Blogging Bootcamp that was put on by WordPress.com. Honestly, in thinking back I can not believe it has been 5 years but also, I know in the past 1.5 years the site has kind of remained the same and there hasn&rsquo;t been the engagement as there was in the first couple of years.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Long story short it is time to say <strong>goodbye</strong>… As of <em><strong>March 1,</strong></em> 2021, it will just remain an archive of information with nothing new posted.</p>
<p>I should probably address some simple questions that you may or may not be asking at this point…<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h5 id="why"><strong>Why?</strong></h5>
<p>Mostly because I feel like it is time and I think in looking at the stats the Community believes it is time as well. I think most people who have joined over the years found that the WordPress Reader does a great job of keeping you up to date on current posts and makes it simple to quickly interact with one another. Not to mention there are Twitter and Facebook that allow people to easily ask questions and interact/follow others with similar interests.</p>
<p>That is not to say I don&rsquo;t think a Community like this couldn&rsquo;t work or isn&rsquo;t valuable. I just think this specific community has run its course and it is time to close down.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h5 id="will-this-be-temporary-with-a-comeback-at-a-later-date"><strong>Will this be temporary with a comeback at a later date?</strong></h5>
<p>No, this is not just temporary. The plan is permanent but I will never say never. If something would ever take the place with the same name it would have to take on a different form altogether in my opinion but at this point, I have no plans to have a comeback tour.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h5 id="wont-you-miss-this"><strong>Won&rsquo;t you miss this?</strong></h5>
<p>Of course, I will miss this, even though I haven&rsquo;t used it much in the last year I believe the site provided a lot of great value over the years. Also, it is something that was created, time was spent dreaming up ideas and executing various actions to make it what it was. It was a passion project and I honestly enjoyed every minute I worked on it even when I was looming over my head to get another task or post published.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h3 id="closing"><strong>Closing</strong></h3>
<p>I could go on and on but in closing, I will miss the community we had as this was such a fun project over the past 5 years, and even though I am the one saying Goodbye I will still miss it. Thanks to EVERYONE who helped pioneer and champion, or those who joined, contributed, and followed along in the past. I wish each and every one of you more success in your blogging careers!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Veil<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Eliot Peper (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->@EliotPeper<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) was just released a week ago and I really can’t say enough good things about it. If you are looking for a great book then look no further as Eliot has produced another great page-turner after not long ago finishing his most recent sequels.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<em>The book was released on May 20th, 2020, but I was lucky enough to get an advanced copy from my good friend Eliot himself. However, I enjoyed the book so much that once it was released I purchased another copy as well for my collection.</em><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Unlike some of Eliot’s other books, I actually felt like this one started a little slower but that was a good thing. As with a lot of good books, it built you up getting to know the characters and backgrounds. Speaking of, the main character, Zia León seems like your normal humanitarian that leads various aid missions to help areas in need. However, what makes Zia unique is she comes with sass and attitude that fits her well in order to get the job done.</p>
<p>As the first part of the story goes I was trying at times to see how all the pieces were going to fit together. Honestly, it took me a little while to start putting the pieces together, and then all of a sudden a kidnapping happened and I could not put this book down. Not only does the story speed up but more is revealed along the way that made it even more of a page-turner. I soon found out that the adventure was just beginning for Zia.</p>
<p>Eliot does it again by looking into the near future and laying out what might happened due to various social/global issues that are relevant in today’s world. With his ability to research those relevant topics, expand on them to plausible future events and outcomes all while crafting other drama into the story always amazes me. Don’t get me wrong there is more to the story than just social events as friendships are tested, betrayal unfolds, and stubborn relationships rear their ugly heads. Everything centers around Zia and she must deal with them all along the way.</p>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>The one thing I appreciate about Eliot’s books is the way he sometimes weaves things from other books into the mix. I might have only caught one referring to an open-sourced software architecture 😃 but I am sure there were more. Additionally, he finds ways to weave current locations and eating establishments that again makes the futuristic feel of this book that much closer to home.</p>
<p>I have really been enjoying Eliot’s near future books as the concepts and issues are not unrealistic to see come to fruition. Not to mention he always seems to be writing about topics that are big and bold and not just ones that change over the course of a year.</p>
<p>This is again one of those books I really can&rsquo;t recommend enough. In a time where politics seems to be guiding best practices for how we deal with climate issues, this book takes you to the near future in the path we could be on.</p>
<p>To make sure you don&rsquo;t miss out on his next books be sure to follow him on twitter (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->@EliotPeper<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) and subscribe to his newsletter from his website (<a href="http://www.eliotpeper.com/">http://www.eliotpeper.com/</a>).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As I mentioned I have read some of Eliot&rsquo;s books before and wrote about them so if you are interested to check out some of his other books go for it as you won&rsquo;t be disappointed!

			 <p>It seems strange trying to look back at the last year when there is so much noise clouding the past couple of days/weeks/months.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I am sure this will be shorter than some of the previous years as I feel like I have a little bit of a mental block. In fact, I was thinking about what I was going to write on the morning of what I deemed 6.2 Birthday miles but I didn’t come up with much. That is not to say that nothing has happened over the past year. Last year I wanted to focus on Embracing things more and trying to cut out things that didn&rsquo;t bring myself or my family joy. Overall, I feel like we kept moving in the right direction. We all continued to focus on things that brought us joy and in some cases started to let go of others.

<em>One last hike in before the storm rolled in and we had to leave Sedona (Airport Loop Trail, May 2019, Sedona, Arizona)</em>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
One of the things as a family we did was a last-minute trip to Arizona last May. We were not planning it at the beginning of the year but as my wife and I started to talk about it it just seemed like a great time to go visit family and also be together as a family. The week turned out great as we spent half the time with our Arizona family and then the other half in Sedona exploring all the trails. In fact, what was only going to be a one night stay we extended it to two as everyone was having so much fun.<br>

<em>Running along the Skywalker trail in the early morning hours (May 2019, Skywalker Trail, Sedona, AZ)</em>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I had a couple overseas work trips this past year and on these travels, I tried my hardest to embrace the surroundings and explore more. While traveling to China I made a point to see the Great Wall and I am happy that I braved the adventure as I found myself alone on the wall as I got there so early in the morning (thanks jet lag). Not all of my work trips had such a spectacular sight to see, however, I made the most of almost wherever I went mostly because my early morning or late afternoon runs would lead me to some interesting overlook or park.

Speaking of running, over the past year I continued on with my running and eventually hit a goal that formulated in my mind as the year went on. In October I had hit a mark of running a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->5K a day for 365 days<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The timing of that seemed to be about perfect as I am looking back at the last 5 months since I don&rsquo;t think I could have kept it up. However, my running goals have been focused more on distance now and not the consistency of every day running. Some other benefits of my odd running achievement were that I embraced the unknown and talked about my running adventure on a podcast called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Off the Couch<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It was something new to me and when they reached out I figured why not.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
With everything that is going on in the world right now and the focus on physically distancing us and the bans on travel in place as well. I think continuing with the theme of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Embracing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> seems fitting. We are in a very interesting time where my wife and I are both working from home and we have all of the kids with us every day for what might be the end of this school year. In addition, with no after school activities or playdates with friends, this is a great time to be together as a family and do things you always feel you never have time for. My wife and I were just commenting the other day how many weekends or nights do we really have nothing going on. So we are going to embrace this time together as a family and hope we all don&rsquo;t want to kill each other in the end 😄.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The episode is talking about my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->365 days of running a 5k every day<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I will give credit to Johnathan Ellsworth and Brendan Leonard the hosts for asking all the right questions to make an episode that was more than 15 min long as we joked about the start of the episode. I had a lot of fun chatting with them and feel privileged to have been on the show as I know they have had some amazing guests.</p>
<p>I hope you give the episode a listen and enjoy the conversation I had with them as I thoroughly enjoyed chatting with them. Finally, if you did enjoy it be sure to give their podcast a review on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iTunes<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to help show support for their show. I have only been a more recent listener and am enjoying it as it keeps me company while running and I really enjoy hearing all of the stories of their guests.<br>

			 <p>These days most of the reading I do is listening to someone read me a book. I have written about this before but I came across this tweet by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->James Clear<!-- raw HTML omitted --> laying out that audio is the biggest trend in books.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="ease-of-listening-using-smartphones-and-headphones">Ease of Listening using Smartphones and Headphones</h3>
<p>His first two points around the change in technology I can&rsquo;t disagree with at all. The increase/change in technology has allowed audiobooks to be much easier to listen too as the technology has provided a very low barrier of entry and use. You can take them with you on the go and not have to worry about finding a cassette or CD player. Yes, you read that right, I just said cassette player. I was in that era where we had walkmans and boomboxes. So not super compact if you wanted to go on a run or walk around the house listening to your book tape. In fact, the first vehicle I purchased out of college had both a cassette and a CD player. Now the van my wife and I just bought 2 years ago doesn&rsquo;t have either.</p>
<p>The other change in technology that is similar but not specifically called out is a change in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->media type<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. As I just discussed with audiotapes and audio CDs, that is more physical stuff you needed to carry around. I remember renting an audiobook tape from the library back in 2004 and it had 10 tapes I had to carry around. I used to make a lot of trips to Chicago from Minneapolis so this is when I first started getting into book tapes as it was a way to pass the 7 hr drive by myself. However, I would have to always make sure to flip the tape or put in the next CD. Now you don&rsquo;t even have to mess with physical media as you can just download it on your phone, or tablet and go. In addition, it is much easier to get audiobooks, you can still get them for free from the library but now instead of having to go to the library to pick up your cassettes or CDs, you can just download them from Overdrive or something else your library might be connected with. Also, if you can&rsquo;t get them from the library or don&rsquo;t want to be put on the waitlist, you can quickly buy them though Audible or other platforms and pretty much listen to it instantly.</p>

<h3 id="everyone-loves-convenience">Everyone loves Convenience</h3>
<p>The third point he makes is the one that is maybe more concerning but even more spot on. I say that it is concerning as I am one of those people. Every year I have this idea in my head I am going to physically read more books but every year I only get though enough to count on one hand. Most of the ones I read like that are advanced copies I get from a friend show writes some pretty amazing books. Honestly, it is the convenience that I continue to stick with audiobooks because I can listen to them while doing a number of other things. I still don&rsquo;t know if that is a great thing to always multitask while listening to books but I don&rsquo;t see myself changing that. Most of the time it is when I am running or driving to work. For both of those activities, audiobooks are the perfect multitasking initiative. Also, both of those activities for me have a defined starting and stopping point that doesn&rsquo;t allow it to flow into other activities.</p>
<p>Another article I was reading titled <!-- raw HTML omitted -->“The Rise and Rise of the Books you Don’t read”<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Clare Thorp touched on a lot of other interesting benefits around audiobooks but one part in there was a different look at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Convenience <!-- raw HTML omitted -->topic above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->“Often audio <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is not <!-- raw HTML omitted -->competing with time spent with books,” says Richard Lennon, publisher at Penguin Audio. “It’s people who are either fitting books and authors into their day in new ways, so people who might be existing readers but have found that during their commute or exercising or cooking dinner, there’s an opportunity to listen. Or it’s an alternative to TV for people who are conscious of their screen time.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bingo!<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Richard validated that a lot of the times when I personally listen to books are times I would not have been sitting on the couch reading a physical book. As it would be hard to run down the streets in the morning with a physical book in my hands.</p>
<p>However, I do listen to audiobooks sometimes in the evening as I am doing small tasks around the house. The only issue with this is that it translates into not just sitting on the couch and relaxing or winding down. It then has me wandering all around the house doing various projects and tasks. Then what ultimately ends up happening is that I continue to listen to it much longer and stay up later than I was anticipating. These are the times that go against what Richard was talking about as it isn’t really a new way and I just cut out a good way to get back to physical books. In fact, these specifically are the times I should have reached for the physical book instead and the more times I don’t I find the more times I don’t even think about physical books.</p>
<h3 id="so-are-you-going-to-change-any-of-your-habits">So are you going to change any of your habits?</h3>
<p>Probably not. Honestly, I do know I am taking the easier way out by listening to books instead of physically reading them but it works for me. Maybe when I am older and have some more time on my hands to sit by a fire or on my couch in the afternoon I will read more physical (or even digital) books.</p>
<p>For now, they are a good companion while running and driving to work so I don&rsquo;t see that changing. The only thing I might try to change very slightly is to listen to less in the evening in a way to either try to read a physical book or do something else with my time.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A couple weeks ago I was on what I called a mini sabbatical but in reality, it was just a week off of work before I started a new job. During that week I fully appreciate and understand why rest is important. I think the overall concept of time away from work is something more companies should figure out how to offer. I know some companies have programs like actual sabbaticals after putting in a number of years at companies. I think the idea is great and I think it could be something done on a smaller scale too. I think the most important aspect is to figure out how to allow people to have some time away from where they can really disconnect.</p>
<p>Disconnecting is what you hear about all the time now and after a week of being fully disconnected, I know there are benefits there. I have always taken time away to spend time with family and I would say I was “disconnecting” from work. However, I was never truly disconnected. I was still getting work emails on my phone and more often than not I carried my work laptop with me to where I was going. So in theory as much as I was saying I was “disconnected” I was still connected by checking and making sure nothing went wrong back at work while I was away. Even if I wasn’t responding to anything, I was still glancing through things to make sure nothing big was going on and filling stuff away in order to make it easier for when I got back to work.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However, on this “break” I didn’t have email or work issues that came up or even could be brought my attention. When I left work on my final day, my email and connection to that job disappeared as well. I was unemployed as I was in between jobs and it was great. I was hoping that my wife and I could have escaped somewhere fun for a couple of days but seeing how this wasn’t planned very far in advance. So my wife still had to work and the kids still had school and their normal after-school activities.</p>
<p>However, that was honestly perfect for me as it allowed me to do more with the kids before and after school as I was still there. However, it also gave me a chance to just do random things during the day from 9am - 4pm when my kids were at school. I took the dog to the dog park where she was just in heaven as there wasn&rsquo;t anyone there and she could just run around as fast as possible.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I spent the week doing things I enjoyed but honestly, I could have had another week to get even more stuff done as I had planned on taking the time to read a book (yep never happened). I did make sure to sneak in a couple of long runs, multiple runs per day, as well as a fun park that was a lot of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hill running<!-- raw HTML omitted --> but worth the views.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In fact, I even met up with my cousin for a run one of the days I was off. It was good to get outside as well as catch up with her.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Finally, I took my wife out on a couple of lunch dates where we could take our time eating and just enjoy each other&rsquo;s company with nothing big to rush to the next event or worry we are paying some babysitter to allow our kids to watch TV at home :).</p>
<p>I am sad that my time away from work is over as I am now three weeks into my new job. However, I am going to think of ways going forward that I can take a week off and just be at home as disconnected as I can. Another thought is to just take some random days off here and there where I can just do my own thing without other priorities or reasons for taking the day off. I believe that would allow me to be refocused and refreshed going back to work the next day.</p>

			 <p>Have any of you been a part of an Online Community? If so I would be curious about what it is, how it works, does it cost you anything and if you feel you have gained any value from it? Feel free to leave a comment below.</p>
<p>I have been a part of a couple over the years and today I want to talk about the Break the Twitch Member Community. I have been a member since the beginning and I will say it has definitely been worth the value I paid and continue to pay. Not only do I get to help keep the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Break the Twitch website<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Podcast<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ad-free but also get access to an amazing community of supporting individuals and other resources. In the community specifically, you will find both Anthony and his wife Amy who are active by either leading and/or contributing to discussions.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now time to interrupt my normal style of writing with some questions and answering in order to fill in the blanks of why this post exists.</p>
<h4 id="ithis-is-great-why-are-you-telling-me-this-is-it-a-sales-pitch-are-you-going-to-get-a-commission-on-thisi"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is great why are you telling me this, is it a sales pitch? Are you going to get a commission on this?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h4>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->NO<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->NO<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This is not a sales pitch and I don’t get anything if you would happen to sign up. Well, I guess technically I get to have you in the community if you sign up so that is something. The real reason I am talking about the Break the Twitch Member Community is to get the word out there. I have been a part of the community for almost 2 years and figured it was time to give a little extra back as I realized that I have never talked about it or said I had joined.</p>
<h4 id="iso-why-did-you-joini"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So why did you join?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h4>
<p>It seems like a fair place to start out. I have been part of communities before and the best communities are made better by the people in them. Each member (the creators are included in this one) is supporting each other along their own journey. Some of our journeys are the same but others are wildly different. That doesn’t matter though because the other members can help become your support system for you to do the tasks or things that matter most.</p>
<p>When I originally joined there were not many of us as it just launched. I didn’t hesitate as I have followed Break the Twitch for years and felt like this way one way for me to give back to a creator trying to create something to help people. Also, I believed in what Anthony was saying from the beginning. A little fun fact, I looked back in all of the posts I have had on this site and I have talked about Break the Twitch more times than I remembered (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->One Decision<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Power of the Habit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fall Clean up and Clean out<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<h4 id="ii-have-been-part-of-communities-before-and-they-sometimes-fizzle-or-conversations-die-out-how-is-the-btt-community-and-why-would-it-be-betteri"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have been part of Communities before and they sometimes fizzle or conversations die out. How is the BTT Community and why would it be better?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h4>
<p>I too have been part of other communities before and in fact, started one that I feel is in that dying out phase of life (more on that other time). By my own experiences in communities, I have found that the best communities need champions and that is where you have Anthony and Amy actively engaging with people in the community. Not to mention all of the other members have some motivation to be active as well because there was a reason we all joined, to begin with. Additionally, since everyone is paying something to be a part of it that brings an increased level of commitment on everyone&rsquo;s part.</p>
<h4 id="isounds-great-but-i-dont-really-want-to-be-active-in-a-community-right-now-or-what-if-i-get-busy-and-cant-be-active-in-the-community-wouldnt-that-mean-i-will-not-really-be-getting-my-valuei"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sounds great but I don’t really want to be active in a community right now or what if I get busy and can’t be active in the community. Wouldn’t that mean I will not really be getting my value?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h4>
<p>Another great question and to be honest I am that person a lot of the time. I will not lie I am not the best community contributor. I come in and out of discussions all of the time. It is not that I don’t find value in the discussion or monthly challenges they have. Trust me they are all great things, but for me, it comes down to my other priorities and which one fits for me at the given month/time. There is always value to be gained as the Break the Twitch Membership allows you access to a library of Audio courses that you have access to all the time. For someone that travels and spending a lot of time running around the streets, these courses are great to load on my phone and hit the road.</p>

<p>Yes, and no. I did meet Anthony for the first time a couple of years back before the Membership community was open. As I said before I had been following Break the Twitch for some time and since we lived in the same area it made it easy to meet up. Meeting him in person confirmed what I had originally thought that he seemed like a super easy to talk to, down to earth, and overall really nice guy. I would have joined the membership community even if I had never met him. However, I will say the way he presents himself on the podcast, and in the Member Community group is how he is in real life.</p>
<p>Speaking of meeting with him, now granted you might not be able to meet him in person as I did, but after signing up you can take him up on the offer of a 20 min coaching call. Not to mention you can interact with him in the Community chat group.</p>
<h3 id="ifinal-thoughtsi"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Final Thoughts<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h3>
<p>Hope you enjoyed this different style of post today. It came about based on a discussion with someone about the community. In addition, I had just completed the longest run I have done in years and some of it is thanks to the Podcast going in my ears that kept pushing me along.</p>
<p>If you have any questions for me about the Community let me know in the comments below as I am more than happy to answer them. Otherwise, I would suggest you check out the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Break the Twitch Community<!-- raw HTML omitted --> page as it has some FAQs at the bottom. Lastly, feel free to reach out to Anthony as you can find him on social media or his email at the bottom of the linked page above.</p>

			 <p>I have used my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fitbit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> since January 2014 after what I remember was a long time trying to decide if I really wanted one and if so which one. Thinking back it has served its purpose well and I will give it some credit for keeping me active over the past years.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Over the course of the timeline above, I used a handful of watches. Most I bought because I wanted GPS capabilities however I did own two that were only step counters. From the data above you are probably wondering why there is a big gap in 2014. Long story short after I decided on getting a Fitbit at the end of 2013, I went for the new Fitbit force since it could actually show the time as I thought it was silly to just have a tracker band on my wrist. Unfortunately for me, I had issues with that watch and had to return it. At that time they didn’t have a replacement as all of them were recalled so they just returned my money in Full.</p>
<h2 id="positives">Positives</h2>
<h3 id="community">Community</h3>
<p>Due to the fact Fitbit was kind of a pioneer in the step tracking market, a lot of people jumped on board quickly. I don’t recall when they started their community to connect with people and have challenges but it has been for as long as I can remember. This is something they did well early on too as it encouraged people to do more in order to try to keep up with family or friends. I enjoyed looking at where people&rsquo;s 7-day averages were and how well I did against them.</p>
<h3 id="customer-support">Customer Support</h3>
<p>Hands down the one thing Fitbit has done (at least from my perspective) from day one is having great customer support. Put aside the question of quality as remember early on this was a new type of technology. I have purchased 5 different <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fitbit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> devices for myself during the 5 year period.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fitbit Force (Step tracker with Time Display) - Recalled</li>
<li>Fitbit Flex (Step Tracker ONLY) - Free replacement after it got water in it</li>
<li>Fitbit Surge (GPS Watch) - Free replacement after the band broke as this version doesn&rsquo;t have removable watch bands</li>
<li>Fitbit Ionic (GPS Watch) - Free replacement after it just died and didn&rsquo;t turn back on</li>
<li>Fitbit Aria (Scale) - Still the original / never got a replacement</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I have had 8 devices. The first one was a factory recall and I got my full purchase price back. For the other 3, I purchased I had issues after a year or more and they replaced the device free of charge. When you spend more than $150 on newer technology and you are frugal it is a relief knowing that they stand behind the product.</p>
<h2 id="main-issues">Main Issues</h2>
<h3 id="reporting-data">Reporting Data</h3>
<p>This was never really an issue years ago but as my use of my Fitbit watch changed it became more apparent. After having my year of running <!-- raw HTML omitted -->5K a day<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and wanting to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->look through the data<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and look back at things, I quickly realized that looking back at specific data in your Fitbit is near impossible. How can I find all of the “Runs” I completed in the previous year.</p>
<p>You can click on the activities tab but everything is an activity and there is no good way to sort by type of activity. In addition, I can’t even easily export the information to do anything else with it. The good thing is most of my runs are in Strava which makes it super simple to export and look back at specific types of Activities (e.g., Runs vs Bike Rides).</p>
<h3 id="unreliable-gps--watch">Unreliable GPS / Watch</h3>
<p>This kind of goes with my gripe above with data, however, a GPS watch itself is only as good as when it is tracking. If I didn’t want to know where and how far I ran, then I would not have paid over $250 for my Fitbit Ionic and just bought a $30 Timex like I used to wear in High School.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>No chance of this watch failing unless the battery ran out.</em></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>The Fitbit Surge was a good watch and my first GPS watch.</em></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>I really did like the Fitbit Ionic as it had a big clear display.</em></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>One of the times my Fitbit failed in the past year around 1 mile into my run. I thought that since you could swim with this watch on it would have been able to survive the rain I was running through.</em></p>
<p>However, since I did spend that money on a GPS watch that is what I want. Below are some great examples of when my Fitbit would just fail me in the middle of the run. I realized that the map makes it look like I stopped and just didn’t complete the loop back to my house. Just for reference though, I do not stop a half-mile from my house as I always make it all the way back to my starting point no matter how much further that makes me run.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="will-i-miss-anything">Will I miss anything?</h2>
<p>I will miss the Community and the data I already have out there. I have tried to pull over as much data as I can into my new system but not all data is created equal even when importing. As I noted before since all of my runs were in Strava that was easier to get and import all of those into a new system.</p>
<p>As for the community, I will miss that as well since two of my kids have Fitbits and it was always fun being able to quickly see how I ranked over them. Even with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3.1 mile runs every day<!-- raw HTML omitted --> my kids still beat me in steps, unless they didn’t wear their watch. However, as for other family and friends, they too have started to drift away from Fitbit.</p>
<p>My guess is most people got Apple watches and didn’t want to wear both. Or if they wanted more of a Runners / Workout watch they went to Garmin or Suunto. I have been connecting with runners on Strava and it seems most drift to Garmin.</p>
<h2 id="question-for-you">Question for you?</h2>
<p>Do you track your steps or fitness activities using a watch? If so what kind do you have? If you have had a Fitbit ever what kind did you have and what are your thoughts on it?</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Fall is one of my favorite times of the year. Mostly because the weather is cooler outside and I have been known to pretend I am allergic to heat and humidity. As a runner, the cooler weather is welcome but you have to live with the downside of running in the dark morning or night hours. However, fall is another time when you need to start thinking about cleaning up the yard of leaves or putting away the summer stuff, and finding all the winter gear.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Since we have younger kids we put up a pool in the summer and an ice rink in the winter. Both of those things require some infrastructure that needs to be stored in the off-seasons. I don’t mind having to put it away but when this happens it always becomes a day project as it gives me some time to really clean up the other clutter that has been accumulating during the other 3-6 months.</p>
<p>I have written before about how we have used <!-- raw HTML omitted -->House Projects to Help Declutter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as well as using the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Seasons<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to help clean up areas of our house as well. However, most of all of that energy in decluttering started after I read the book “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The More of Less<!-- raw HTML omitted -->” by Joshua Becker. Not only did the book energize me to start some of those decluttering projects around my house but also the book gave me access to a course that connected me with a community of people who wanted to and were going through the same process.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Uncluttered<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was the course and it was great because it was only a 12-week course focusing on various aspects of becoming uncluttered. However, in reality, the underlying message was not to just trash everything and live in a house with nothing. No… because who would really want to do that. The course walked you through how to figure out what is important to you and helps challenge your thinking of what is important so in the end, you hopefully will know exactly what is important and lift the weight by removing the other “stuff” cluttering your life.</p>
<p>The best part about the course is that you get lifetime access. So for someone like me, I enjoy that because I have done the course a couple of different times. Not only as a refresher but also as a way to get motivated again. As I said at the beginning of this article, I have two big clean-up events every year due to the infrastructure of outside stuff I need to put away. I am approaching one right now and even though I would love to say I decluttered our house once and after that, all was well… Well, that is not the case, it is something you have to intentionally work at going forward because let&rsquo;s face it everyone is busy and stuff can start to pile up again. So for me retaking this course that continues to inspire me is time and initial money well spent.</p>
<p><em>Ok, I need to make something clear because I do not want you to think I am trying to pull one over on you. I know the previous paragraph seemed a little sales pitchy. Note that is not my intention,  I am only telling you things from my own experience and no one is paying me to write this article. I would not try to convince you that something is good if I have never used it before and given it a try.</em></p>

			 <p>You asked for it so let&rsquo;s dive into the data! I knew this was going to be a follow-up post to the one I just <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wrote earlier this week<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about my 5K a day. Maybe it is because I am kind of a data nerd and you were shocked I didn’t publish any data or charts with my last article. Or maybe it is because you wanted to see when and how far, fast or what time of day I completed my runs. It could have been that you were not 100% sure you believed me in my last article and were waiting to see some proof.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="when-did-you-run">When did you run?</h2>
<p>This is one of the first questions I got after my previous post, When did I do most of my running? I have been asked this question by friends and family members before and without looking at the chart my answer was always the morning without a doubt. With 3 kids in activities, the morning was the one time I could really control what I did. If I didn’t do it first thing there was always a chance that plans could change and I would be doing it at midnight. However, it did get me thinking about how often I ran the rest of the day over the past 12 months.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="friday-mornings-take-the-real-win">Friday Mornings take the real WIN!</h2>
<p>After looking at that last set of data I pondered if there was anything else I would like to see. That is when it hit me that it would be interesting to see based on the day of the week when did I typically run.</p>
<p>I was not really sure what to expect on this chart before pulling it together. The only thing I could think of was besides mornings probably being pretty spread out during a given week. I would have thought more evening runs as I would try to squeeze them in right after work or while at a kid&rsquo;s activity. As you can see from the data below, that is not entirely what is being shown.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After looking over the chart below I came to two realizations:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="pace">Pace</h2>
<p>Finally, after I was pulling all this data together I was wondering what was my average pace over the course of these 12 months. The overall answer is 7:47 min miles. I decided to create some quick average charts by day and month. The day chart kind of puzzled me except when thinking about the other data above. I most likely got better rest before my Saturday run as I didn’t always have to do it at dawn.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>When you look at the monthly chart this is even more interesting but I have a few ideas of why it might look like it does.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>From when I started till about January I was on a steady decline. However, those runs were mostly solo in nature and a more consistent route due to darkness, and early snowfall. Don’t forget it got cold in January and I might have tried to run faster outside just to get the run done in the early morning.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<em>Running with my daughter and the dog. Not a bad way to start the day as it is always filled with conversations. Not to mention more stops by both to see and listen to nature (March 2019, Eden Prairie, MN)</em><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<em>Frozen face run in -9.4°F (February 2019, Eden Prairie MN)</em><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The Spring months I was running more with Lainey Lou the Doodle (our dog) which then slowed down my pace. In addition, I would run sometimes with my daughter who would like to bike along with me and sometimes she just wanted to stop. Finally, in the late April / May timeframe it was starting to get nicer out that I could do more trails around the area. In May especially, I was traveling and was running in the hills of Arizona, streets of China and a number of Treadmill runs due to the arrival of flights. I know that Treadmill run data was about the worst because I only have my watch data to go on and most of the time it never said I ran as far as the treadmill said I did.</p>
<p>So after all of my analysis above, I got to thinking I might be missing some data here that might be in addition to the chart above. The one above only gave average pace but I was more curious about what the min and max were as well. I think this chart helps answer some of those questions.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Looking at the chart above I think it further supports my hypothesis of running in different places and on the treadmill.</p>
<h2 id="fastest-times">Fastest Times</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I figured since I was sharing all of this data anyways I should probably share some Personal Bests during my year of running. I was thinking of doing a chart like some of the above but I realized I didn&rsquo;t really have good data around this. Mostly because I didn&rsquo;t always stop running right at 3.1 miles, so it would be hard with the data I have to give more meaning than overall bests.</p>
<p>Luckily, Strava has some overall personal bests that I could easily get and all of them except for the 10k came from a race I did in the summer. In looking at the data now, I wish I would have broken the 20 min mark but I can&rsquo;t really complain as I was never shooting for a specific time. Also, I did well as I was in the top 15 overall and  2nd in my age group.</p>
<p>I actually did 2 races over the past year and surprised myself during both of them with good enough times considering I was running every day with no breaks. Running a 5k a day made me realize that running those 5K races were really nothing. I did them every day so it wasn&rsquo;t a big deal, I knew I would finish it so then it was just a matter of at what point in the race should I pick up my pace or pass someone.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I never really set out to put any data together when I originally started running. In fact, I didn’t really think about it when I realized that I was actually going to be running for a year. To both of those facts, I might have been a little short-sided, as looking back I would have done things differently in order to make sure I had the data easily available. I would not have used it to change what happened on a day to day basis as my goal was never to run faster or even longer. I did use my Strava data and my Fitbit data to just look back at a given week or compare runs every now and then to see if there was any small progress. However, my ultimate goal was the consistency of doing it every day.</p>

			 <p>I ran a 5K a day for 365 Days in a row and counting… Most people will think that is crazy and pointless. I have run well over 1131.5 miles over the course of the past year (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->check out the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->data analysis<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> of all my runs or give a listen to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Off the Couch podcast<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I was on talking about it<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). On September 17th, 2018 I started this journey but I didn’t have the goal of a 5K a day in my mind. Or certainly, my intention was not to do it for an entire year.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I have always been a runner, or so I say I have always been a runner. There was a time I distanced myself from running in my later college years up until about 4 years ago. I actually wrote about it a couple of times ok maybe more than a couple but I wrote about it when I got <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Back into Running<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and when I was using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Running to Refocus<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>There is something great about running as it is just PURE. You can only move as fast as YOU can, as far as YOU want, and as long as YOU can. However, it is all up to YOU to determine what YOU “can” do and what you get out of it.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="planning-is-key">Planning is Key</h2>
<p>Honestly, this is the biggest takeaway I learned over the past year was planning. If you want to make something a priority you need to plan time for it in order for it to be a priority. For me in order to make running a priority in my life, I had to make sure to keep it a priority, and sometimes I had to get creative. I would look at my schedule on a day to day or even a week out and figure out when I planned to run. This sounds a little crazy that on a Sunday night I was already planning on when I was going to run the following Saturday but honestly I had to do it. Not just for when it would make sense to me, like running in the morning, but for my family and other work priorities. I found myself running early in the morning, late at night, and sometimes squeezing it in while my son was at a birthday party. Then there was the weather. That would always through a wrench in it if I would have let it. However, after my habit was formed I just told myself it didn’t matter the weather, rain or shine, snow or ice, 100 degrees and humid or 0 degrees with a negative windchill, I would make sure to get my run in.</p>
<h2 id="around-the-neighborhood">Around the Neighborhood</h2>
<p>Something that I have enjoyed over the past 4 years of running is exploring my surroundings. In my neighborhood, I have found so many small parks, trails, and green spaces that I didn’t know existed in the first 6 years we lived there. Mostly because I would just drive by and not give it a second look. However, by increasing my mileage as well as the frequency of runs, I found myself exploring more places because I needed more routes and I was going farther.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Also, in my town and some of the surrounding areas, I went to other parks not near my house in order to find a new and interesting place to run. Some of which I then took my family back to so would could all explore at a later time to really take in the scenery.<br>

<p>Not only did I find some amazing places in my town, but since I travel for work from time to time, I found some even more interesting places while running in various cities. Not only did I explore near my hotel but in some cases, I would drive to find a trail to run on.

<p>Besides breaking in my new Asics pair of shoes as I feel I have gone through quite a few this past year. I might try to take a different approach for this next year. My goal is to get some longer runs in but feel I need to back off on the times per week in order to make that happen. Some of it is because of the time commitment which is partially due to my own schedule but also with the lack of daylight we have right it does add to the challenge. I am guessing it will be a slow transition as I have conditioned my body to run daily it is not super easy to just stop. Trust me I have tried. Till the next update get outside and start exploring your neighborhood.<br>

			 <p>Something is New around here&hellip; Welcome to Up North!
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I am certain you have noticed that the blog has changed ever so slightly as it is no longer called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Still Thinking&hellip;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> In all honesty, nothing about the blog specifically has changed from a content perspective I just decided after a little over 4 years I wanted a new name and maybe a fresh start at this. So I</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I doubt anything will really change right now as I am enjoying the current non-specific schedule. I think if anything you will see some more writing about thoughts and experiences. In addition, I am sure I will just share some shorter things that might be of interest or making me think from time to time.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I was actually looking back at some of my earlier posts on this site the other day, and one post called &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Going back to the beginning<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; caught my attention. There is a sentence in there that probably sums up what this blog has been and might be for eternity.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am blogging as a way to share interesting stories and thoughts.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="ok-ok-i-get-all-of-that-but-why-up-north">Ok, ok, I get all of that but why Up North!</h3>
<p>I am sure at the time I was thinking about it I had a much better reason. However, it really came down to I wanted a change and something simple. I live in what some call the Bold North or that is how it was advertised during the Superbowl and it has kind of stuck around for some. Also, when I think of Up North, I think of someone spending time outside and that my friend is something I enjoy. After I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->refound my love of running<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I try to get outside almost daily now as it is almost like therapy. In addition, over this past year, I have made it a priority to explore more of the parks and trails around my city as I have regretted such a thing in my past life.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Sum all of that up and the name just stuck for me as it meant something.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
For those of you that have been with me for a while or if you are new here I am thankful no matter what. I hope everyone sticks around and as always leave me a comment if you have any suggestions, questions, or just want to drop me a note.</p>

			 <p>We started out with some solo hikes / runs around the hotel. Then we went o the Sedona Airport Loop which had great views on the hike. It might have been a good idea to all turn back as it ended with two of us running in the rain. However, then we all claimed a lookout to take some pictures in the rain. Finally, we drove back to Phoenix (through hail nonetheless) and played games with Kent, and hung out with Great Grandma Gott before the big kids and I had to run to the airport. Such a great short trip with tons of family time.</p>

			 <p>Last year was spent focusing on things that mattered not only to myself but my family too. I felt overall it was a very successful endeavor that allowed me to improve my health, mental state, as well as family time.</p>
<p>Early on in the year we definitely decided to make Family a priority and carve out some time throughout the year. One of the first things that kind of popped up unexpectedly was that each kid got a mini vacation with a parent. My wife took our oldest and youngest to Arizona at different times as they coincided with other family events. Then I took our middle child on a daddy-daughter trip to Duluth where we spent time wandering around and exploring via kayak sea caves. Since I wasn’t at either of the Arizona trips, I can speak more to our trip to Duluth, MN and it was really fun. It was great to just connect one on one with our children since most of the time we have multiple around us.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Another trip that sparked after some of the initial kid/parent trips earlier in the year was with a weeks notice we decided to take a family road trip to Colorado. This was a big highlight for all as it was really last minute and we were able to visit a number of things along the way. As much as I know traveling by plane is much quicker, sometimes just jumping in the car and driving to destinations is well worth it. The journey is part of the overall experience and the kids still do remember it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Another first this past year was camping and spending a lot of time at the Iowa State Fair. I can admit it publicly that it was actually a lot more fun than I would have expected but then again it has not been a dream of mine to do like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wifes’<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. After experiencing it last year and seeing the pure joy on my kids faces every day even though most days we did the exact same things brought me joy as well. Not to mention days, weeks, and months after the Iowa State Fair, our kids keep talking about it and we also find them pretending they are at the Iowa State Fair when playing downstairs.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Focusing on my health and mental state kind of went hand in hand but didn’t really take shape till late this past year. What I found was running was not only good for my mental state but I know there are health benefits there too. In the fall, I really started to up my running from what was 2-3 times per week to every single day. It still kind of amazes me that I started it but more amazed that I have been keeping up with it for the past 6 months. My excuse has always been that I never had the time to run longer or more days in a week. It was really tough at first but then I got creative and also started to understand where I failed in the past and planned ahead in order to be successful.</p>
<p>Finally, besides everyone being healthy we welcomed a new member of our family this year after the passing of our pets the prior two years. So meet Lainey Lou the Miniature Petite Golden Doodle.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As you can see she is not as petite as she was when we first got her :) .</p>
<p>Everyone in the family loves her to death even though we miss our old pets. This has oddly enough been a little bit of an adjustment as we really did take advantage of a pet free lifestyle over the summer. Now that everything has changed, it is a good change but we are back to moring upfront planning to make sure Lainey can either come with us or has another place to stay.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If I am true to myself in this upcoming year I know this will be a challenge to keep but I am really up for it as it has been on my mind for a while.</p>

			 <p>It hit me that I have been consuming so much so fast that I haven’t had time to actually think about what it means. This is further expanding on the topic I discussed a while back titled <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Media Consumption<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I have listened to some great Podcasts and read some great articles. Some of them have great nuggets of information that I write to myself thinking I will expand on it soon. The problem is that I never have time to execute that idea. I just end up with pages of notes that I will never look back at because I am already consuming the next block of information.</p>
<h3 id="the-neverending-stream-of-information">The Neverending stream of Information</h3>
<p>As you can see from the picture below I have a podcast listening problem big time. Don’t get me wrong I like all of them but there is never enough time. Mostly I listen to podcasts while running. However, it is also really easy to just keep listening to these wonderful podcasts after I return from a run or during downtimes like walking the dog, walking into work, folding laundry, working around the house and the list could go on and on.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Hence lies the problem that I might be consuming too much information versus creating my own output or reflecting on what I have heard. Every time I read articles, books, or even listen to books or podcasts I always have this great intention of sitting down at the computer and writing out some thoughts like I am doing right now. However, as you have noticed from my very sporadic posting schedule, I never quite get back to the creation side of things.</p>
<p>On a run a while back I was planning to hit a feat I had not done in a long time by cranking out a 6-mile run. About 2 miles in my Bluetooth headphones died and all I had was silence. It was a strange feeling but good strange. I was just listening to my breathing, my feet hitting the pavement, and animals making noises in the distance.</p>
<p>It made me think that maybe I do need to rethink when I consume vs create or maybe I just need times of silence. In fact, it might just be that I need more time to think through what I had been consuming instead of just going right on to the next book or the next podcast. It is almost too easy to just let the next in queue startup without even thinking about it or digesting what was said.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-next">What is next!</h3>
<p>Obviously, the answer is easy but sometimes you just need to hear other people say it for it to sink in. I think Cody Warner said perfectly in one of is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->daily vlogs<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from a while back…</p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stop Watching… Start Doing!  - Cody Warner<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I look for areas to improve on, this tweet I ran across below might be a good rule to follow.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h4 id="other-articles-on-this-topic">Other Articles on this Topic</h4>
<p>If you have been thinking about this too, or wonder what other people have to say on this topic I am sure there are a bunch of other articles you can find. Towards the end of 2018 I was hearing a lot of people talk about it. Below are two articles that stuck out in my mind and each are taking different approaches.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thinking about Attention<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> by CGP Grey<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>CGP Grey, where he talks about stepping back from the internet almost completely. I don’t disagree with his thoughts as I too feel my attention span may be affected by always being connected and getting bit-sized pieces of information instead of long-form. For me personally, I consume more long-form listening than reading and even though I try to actually read a couple of books a year it is a challenge for me to stay focused. Grey may be taking a drastic approach that I am sure will work well for him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A New Case for Unsubscribing from Nearly Everything<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Cait Flanders<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cait actually has more than the one article touching on this topic as if you follow her you know she started slowly taking steps back from how she consumed information from the internet. She is not completely stepping away from the internet and just focusing on what mediums she wants to “subscribe” to as a way to ensure she can focus on other projects that are important to her. In another article (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Why I’m Retiring from Personal Blogging<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) she wrote about intentionally creating space in our lives for things we want to do.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->When we intentionally create space in our lives, we can intentionally decide what to fill it with. - Cait Flanders.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="going-forward">Going Forward</h3>
<p>I have not entirely figured out the best way for me to scale back my information consumption but will continue focusing on it going forward. If you have started to scale back yourself what has worked well for you?</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bandwidth<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Eliot Peper (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->@EliotPeper<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) is definitely another page turner by one of my favorite authors.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was lucky enough to get an advanced copy to read but I also bought the Kindle version as well so needless to say it is definitely worth picking up. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you are a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kindle Unlimited Member<!-- raw HTML omitted --> you can get it for Free. Otherwise, it is $4.99 to buy which is a great deal as well!<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Bandwidth wastes no time from the first page dropping you right into the action as it captivates your imagination of a world not that far into the future. You will quickly figure out that the main character Dag Calhoon, a lobbyist representing high-powered tech and energy executives, starts questioning the world he has been helping create. In this world, every person has a &ldquo;feed&rdquo; (like social media) that is always in people&rsquo;s minds and is integral to how the world works. As the story evolves, Dag stumbles upon a group of activists that have hijacked people&rsquo;s feeds in order to sway public options and global markets. He eventually is faced with big decisions as he tries to figure out what is right/wrong and whom to trust.</p>
<p>I would say Eliot has done a good job in changing the types of books I have been custom to over the past couple of years. Where three years ago I would have said I read more Mystery or Action-Adventure and typically would have stayed away from Sci-fi type books. This book (like some of his others) is not what I would consider your typical Sci-fi books but more &ldquo;near-term sci-fi&rdquo; as it seems more within reach in the next decade.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I really can&rsquo;t recommend this book enough and as always don&rsquo;t want to give too much of it away. So I would suggest you go <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reserve a copy<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>To make sure you don&rsquo;t miss out on his next books and sequel to Bandwith titled Borderless, be sure to follow him on Twitter (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->@EliotPeper<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) and subscribe to his newsletter from his website (<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.eliotpeper.com/">http://www.eliotpeper.com/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>

			 <p>Wow is it really that time again? Time to end another year and start the next.</p>
<p>It really seems strange to say goodbye to 36 and hello to 37. I think saying 37 seems so odd to me as it is that much closer to 40 and 30 seems so long ago.</p>
<p>This past year was one of the big ups and big downs. The family road trip that we took from Minnesota to Maine last summer was a huge success and the kids had a blast. In fact, the fear of the 26-hour car ride was very eventless as there wasn’t much complaining by the kids (or parents) at all on the way out or the 2-day trek back. Our family is definitely ready to hit the road again and are making plans for a West Coast trip in 2019.</p>
<p>This past year I did do a good job of slowing my own busy schedule down in a couple of areas (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Slowing Down to Redirect<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). I am going to continue to focus on this going forward as I want to challenge myself in the time I spend in various side/volunteer projects and make sure I am getting out of it what I would expect.</p>
<p>However, this year brought on more sadness as 13-year-old Yorkshire Terrier <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PJ<!-- raw HTML omitted --> passed away and now for the first time in 14 years, we don’t have any pets in the house. It feels very quiet and I do miss having a four-legged friend following me around from time to time but I am not ready to get another one yet.</p>
<p>Additionally, not long after that, I had to say goodbye to my Grandma as well. It is not the first death I have ever had to deal with but it was one of the firsts where I actually went to see her days before and tell her goodbye in person. When the person is completely coherent and knows she is waiting for the time, it makes it that much more surreal when you take a step back. There is always things you wish you would have done with the person or talked to the person about before that point but it give you one last chance to say something to them that you know they are hearing and responding to you about.</p>
<p>Right after both of those sad events, I pretty much boarded a plane and had to spend two weeks in Germany on a work trip. I felt bad leaving my wife and kids for so long but it was an experience that I really enjoyed and can’t wait to take my wife to Germany in the future. Almost all of the trip was work-related but over the weekend I spent my time in Cologne which was amazing. It is mind-blowing how much history can be in one city and how far back some of the buildings (and ruins under the city) date. My last whole week in Germany was spent working in our Berlin office, that also was also very interesting as there is so much history in that city from WWI, WWII and the Berlin Wall. In fact, it was interesting just talking to the people at my company that lived through the time the wall was up and how it affected their families.</p>
<p>Towards the end of 2017 and into the start of 2018, my new word that will carry me through is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->focus<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I guess you could say year 37 will be the year of focusing… On what you ask? Nothing particular and everything :)</p>
<p>I am looking forward to what 37 will now bring to me I know there will probably be new adventures and changes of some sort. Describing it as the year of focus will definitely mean that certain things will need to change as I am focusing in on various areas of my life that are most important to me. As always some changes will be quick and others will be a long game approach but setting the steps today for later down the road.</p>
<p>I look forward to checking in next year&hellip;</p>

			 <p>Year 2 has come and gone… As I am excited to see another year of people using the Blogging Meetup, I hold back a little bit as I know I have been very distanced from it in the last year as I was working to prioritize various extra projects in my life last year.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>On the positive side of things, I was happy to finally finish the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Members post page<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which is really just an RSS feed from all members sites. However, on the flip side, I am not sure if people have found it useful or worthwhile. Some of that is I am not able to get any stats from it so unsure if links are being clicked on or not.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the short term, however, I am going to figure out a way to kick off the like follow share again but maybe I will try to incorporate it with the RSS feeds from members' sites in order to get people looking at something that is newly posted. Over the next several months I am going to really take a hard look at the Blogging Meetup and see where this site should be taken. I am going to hope for feedback from the community as I don’t want to just make this decision alone.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A little over a week ago we had to make another tough decision in our house as our last dog Princess Jezzabella the Diva of Pink aka PJ was put down. It was honestly like deja vu all over again as my wife and I have talked about it since the passing of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tucker<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a year and a half ago. We honestly never thought PJ was going to survive without him but she proved us wrong. In fact, I feel like she changed her normal behavior of a dog who kept to herself into one wanting more attention and love from us than ever before.</p>
<p>PJ had been with us for 13 years, with another birthday knocking on the door this June 21st. She was the second of our &ldquo;kids&rdquo;, and she has lived in Michigan (where we got her from), Illinois and Minnesota. It was a really tough decision to make, one that we thought two years ago would have been easier than it really was. However, with the different version of PJ over the last couple of years becoming closer with our kids and the fact that we would then soon be a household with no pets for the first time in the last 15 years.</p>
<p>In these final weeks she was throwing up almost daily and her breathing was sounding labored. This was on top of her eyesight fading as well as her hearing is going as well. So she would often bark at us and get scared as people would move around the house or come near her. Not that we will ever know how much pain she was in but we could tell she was not enjoying life as she knew it anymore.</p>
<p>We believe our decision was right as we saw her health declining we didn&rsquo;t want her to suffer from day to day. Also, selfishly we didn&rsquo;t want her last days to be ones where we would be angry that she was throwing up all over and barking at us constantly.</p>
<p>As with our first dog, we wanted to be with her until the end and in our minds, that was again non-negotiable. We ended up using the same place that comes out to your house and performs the procedure with you being able to be right next to them.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Finally around 5:20 we got the knock on the door and we knew that our time was finally up. It was a little harder this time as we knew what was going to happen and who knows PJ probably knew as well. I am glad that we could be with her the entire time as I still think it would be just as hard dropping her off someplace and then turning around and walking the other way.</p>
<p>PJ, you truly were an amazing dog and I will miss you dearly. You never were the super cuddle bunny that Tucker was but you stepped up and filled that void in a time we needed it most. In fact, maybe it was always in your nature but you just let Tucker fill that role as you liked to be the ferocious protector. Thanks again for the times you were there for me and making my life a little bit better/more exciting. You will always be remembered.</p>

			 <p>I can&rsquo;t believe today would have marked my 6th consecutive year of helping out with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->US Pond Hockey Championships<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (USPHC). However, due to my travel schedule this year I will be unable to help. Instead, I am getting ready to fly back to Minnesota this morning from a work trip. As sad as it is to break such a good streak and tradition, I figured I would reflect back on my prior times volunteering and how I came to be a volunteer 6 years ago.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So you decided to take a day off work and volunteer to stand on the ice for 8 hours in what could be really cold January weather?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Fair question, this probably piqued my interest more as I had just acquired the used materials for a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->backyard rink<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and was in the process of getting it ready for the cold. So as I was hearing about and seeing all of these pictures online of skating in the middle of a lake on an actual pond, I now wanted to see this event in person and watch some games.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Quick side story, I grew up in Iowa and have never played hockey in my life or really ice-skated in any prolonged amount of time. I used to rollerblade and play roller hockey in the street but nothing on the ice.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>If you have made it this far and want to see what it looks like check out the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->US Pond Hockey Championships YouTube channel<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as they have some amazing videos from 2016 and 2017. I hope they put one out again this year as they get some amazing shots of the games and tournament. I am looking forward to hopefully helping out again next year as I always have a great time volunteering. Oh, and did I mention they give out some good hats. ?</p>

			 <p>Have you ever wondered which WordPress platform is right for you? Maybe you are just curious what some of the differences (pros and cons) between WordPress.com and WordPress.org. I am going to walk you through my most recent thought process because after using WordPress.com for the past two years I am moving it back to the self-hosted WordPress.org.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I loved the ease of which WordPress.com just works and you don&rsquo;t have to worry about anything in the back end. If your goal is to just start writing and see where it goes I would recommend it. There is no hosting provider to find, no installs, no plugins, no making sure you backup data, no worrying about indexing, no worrying about SEO optimization or anything. You just walk through the steps on WordPress.com and create a site. The only time you need to think a little bit more is if you are actually going to pay for a domain name or pay for some of the other upgrades.</p>
<p>Two years ago I wrote <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wordpress.com or WordPress.org and Why?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which outlined at the time my thoughts and reasons of why I was moving my self-hosted WordPress.org site to WordPress.com. The big reason as I touched on before was I just wanted to Write/Post. I didn’t want to get caught up in worrying about other things because at that time I didn’t care. WordPress.com makes it super simple to Like, Comment, and Follow other blogs. It really can make a new Blogger feel good about the progress you are making and honestly who doesn’t like knowing that people have read their stuff.</p>
<p>However, all of those easy features come with limitations. You realize that you can’t use Google Analytics in the cheaper versions, add some custom code linking to other forms or email captures, further tweaking of how themes look and work. I think when you get to that point you really need to consider moving off of WordPress.com unless you want to pony up to the Business Version. Here is a quick rundown 2 years later of my pluses and minus of each:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now you can enable WordPress likes for posts and comments via JetPack!<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The only limitation to WordPress.com is Post Tags are not searchable in WordPress.com Reader.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I hope you found this article helpful in understanding some of the differences that I have noticed between both of them. There have obviously been other articles written about this in much greater detail on the pros and cons.  Here are two of my favorites:</p>

			 <p>Becoming more focused requires an even greater skill at keeping your focus.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As I have been trying to write more, I have realized that sometimes when I am about to call an article (or topic) good and close my document for the day&hellip; Another idea pops into my head and I then start writing out words and thoughts about that topic. In fact, it is happening right now as this is the third blank document that I have started writing today and each topic is different but related.</p>
<p>I always find it interesting when and how ideas come and go. There will be times when I just sit and stare at a blank screen wondering what I could write. I have a whole bunch of ideas but they don&rsquo;t interest me at that specific time. Then there are other times where I am writing away and going to call it good for that topic only to jump over and start a new topic because I am in the zone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone should write a blog, every day, even if no one reads it. There’s countless reasons why it’s a good idea and I can’t think of one reason it’s a bad idea.&rdquo; - <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Seth Godin<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Unmistakable Creative Podcast</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To that point, I couldn&rsquo;t agree more when people say to <strong>just write every day</strong>. Just let the words flow out on-screen (or paper) even if it is something you will never publish. The worst thing that happens is that you spent some time writing. The upside, however, is that you just crushed it and wrote a whole bunch of amazing content.</p>
<p><em>Now to flip the discussion</em>… <strong>Is it a bad thing to write about different topics and have a lot of them going at the same time?</strong></p>
<p>I would say I fall into this camp and I am not sure if it is a good thing or not. The only downside I can see right now is that I write a little bit about each of the topics I am working on and never fully finish any of them. Because I keep jumping around from one to the other adding a sentence here or there or just rereading my thoughts.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when I get to a point of not knowing what to write, I have some drafts already started that I might be able to just pick right back up where I left off and hopefully complete it.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you do in order to keep focused on your current writing or the drafts you have going?</strong></em></p>

			 <p>Sometimes things happen (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Crash!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) and it is something that you don&rsquo;t or aren&rsquo;t really sure if someone is going to tell you to try again. Or give you that extra encouragement/voice you need to get back up and try it again. After that post, I wasn&rsquo;t up to what I had hoped for motivation as I struggled to motivate myself in the least.</p>
<p>My instincts were telling me to continue to plug away at this injury slowly and that it was for some reason important to overcome this so I could get out and run like normal. In July I tried again to just get out and run but honestly, I had even less motivation to do that as I blamed my upcoming family vacation and the extra work I needed to do prior to vacation as my crutch.</p>
<p>Then we were finally during the middle of our family trip to the East Coast, and something deep inside me had me throw in my running shoes. Thankfully I did as after nine days into the trip, our final day in Boston before we headed up to Maine, I laced up my shoes to hit the streets. For some reason, I was up really early and figured now is the time to get out and just run around the neighborhood and see the sights of this city I don&rsquo;t live in.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I am really glad I did! I was able to see the places I had seen the day before but with no one else in sight. In fact, it was just so peaceful out there if it wasn&rsquo;t that I wanted to get back to the hotel at a specific time I am not sure where I might have ended up.</p>
<p>That one run though helped start me on the path of getting out of my funk. In fact, it kind of reminded me that that is what helps me stay grounded. As I reflect back I was remembering the video I saw that I was going to post around the time of my Crash and was hoping to at a later point in time but completely forgot as I never really got out of that funk.</p>
<p>My example was getting me back to running and I will even say today I am finally feeling 100% back to normal running which is what I have been waiting to say for a long time. Everyone always has something to be down on, depressed about, or are just mopey about something. The challenge is trying to find something that works for you to get out of your current funk or mood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have never gone on a run or a bike ride or anything outside and thought back to myself I shouldn&rsquo;t have done that, that was really dumb to go on a run. Never! It&rsquo;s always a good thing. - Ryan Van Duzer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The video I have included below by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ryan Van Duzer<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->@duzer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) is what I had watched right before my Crash! and there is some really good nuggets of insight and motivation that he offers while running in the hills of Colorado to get out of his own funk.</p>
<p>I can relate to his methods of remembering there is a whole lot of good things in life. Also, for me, one of the best ways for me to do that when things are stressful at work, home, or just something hard that I need to overcome, is that I just love getting out there to run. It clears my head and gives me a good start or end to the day.</p>

			 <p>Fall is definitely that time of year when things need to be cleaned up. You need to head out to the garage and start putting summer stuff away and bring out the winter stuff (wait not yet.. please not winter yet..). Honestly, though this is the perfect time of year to start decluttering. My wife and I did this last year and pretty much downsized our bedroom to 1 dresser (total) and a closet that is only 8x4. Needless to say, we got rid of a lot of stuff and it was the best thing to do.</p>
<h2 id="our-approach">Our Approach</h2>
<p>We honestly didn&rsquo;t have a specific approach in mind as well have just cleaned rooms from time to time over the 8 years we have lived here and as kids grew up and changed rooms we would then clean that room. More specifically, we would just move the junk to another room. So we finally realized that with 3 kids and all the stuff they have we obviously needed to make some changes and we felt that our room was the best one as it was a space we could control. So instead of doing lots of spaces or things at once we just focused all our efforts on that one room. It did help that once we got started we had the goal in mind of getting rid of one dresser in order to feel like we had more space in our bedroom and it didn&rsquo;t feel like everything was stacked on top of each other.</p>

<p>A year later and we have still been working on the other rooms of our house but it is something that takes time. Decluttering your house is not an easy feat unless you are just moving from college and haven&rsquo;t acquired anything. We got derailed this past year with the kitchen remodel but in a way that helped us declutter all of those rooms affected. The one thing if you move from room to room like my wife and I are doing you need to make sure you don&rsquo;t just go dump things back in a room you have already cleared out. However, that is one of the hardest things so when you get down to only a couple rooms left (like we are now) it gets harder and harder to get it to what you want. However, I am looking forward to the challenge this fall again as the seasons are changing.</p>
<p>If this is something that interest you and you have been wanting to get rid of a lot of stuff I would suggest that you check out what Anthony Ongaro is doing over at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Break The Twitch<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. In fact, the video below is a good way to get started with the 6 most Popular Methods.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Another good resource and guide is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;The Art of Tidying Up: A Complete Guide to a Decluttered Life&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Rebecca Moses</p>

			 <p>I stumbled across this article over the weekend and it really resonated with me and I had to share. You should take the time to go read it and come back, but honestly, Seth Levine’s 5 points are really all you need to know.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I can sympathize with Seth and everyone else as I feel like a lot of us fall into this trap of always trying to take on more and more. Then eventually we hit a wall and have to assess our current situation in order to try to redirect our efforts. That happened to me about 9 months ago when work was getting busier and I was still involved in a lot of other volunteer projects and side projects. I think it finally hit me when I was at a couple of my son&rsquo;s basketball practices and realized I spent the whole time in the hallway on a conference call for a non-profit I volunteered for. During this same time, I was getting swamped with some side projects I was working on as well as since it was that time of year when lots of work needed to happen with them.</p>
<p>So I took a step back with all the information I had and told myself pretty much the five steps that Seth outlined above. I <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->NEEDED<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to slow down, I was doing extra things outside my day job that was cutting into my other relationships (i.e., Family and Friends). Ultimately, I knew nothing could change right at that moment as I had made commitments to the people counting on me for the side project work that was being done and the non-profit needed me till they found a replacement. I decided at that point I wanted to take the step of letting the non-profit know I had to move on. I don’t have anything bad to say about the non-profit and in fact, I really enjoyed all of my time working for them and still, today wish I was on the board. However, that was the first best step. As for the side projects, I decided to not take on or start anymore until Fall when I would reassess my current workload and family time.</p>
<p>Fast forward today, I think my redirection of my where I was spending time paid off. In fact, it made the summer more enjoyable as it was fewer things to worry about when we took our 17-day road trip. Also, as the school year just started it has allowed me to be more involved in my kid&rsquo;s activities by assist coaching.</p>
<p>As for my existing side projects, I am still trying to figure out if I need to cut back on them but for right now I think with the other smaller things I cut out of my schedule through the summer I should be in a good place come next February to push through the work on those projects and continue to support those that are counting on me.</p>

			 <p>Money has been on my mind for a post lately, in fact, you could say I think about it all the time. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(With my mind on my money and my money on my mind. - Snoop Dogg)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  So when the Blogging Meetup prompt of the day was “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Money<!-- raw HTML omitted -->”, I knew this was the sign I had been waiting for.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You can&rsquo;t blame me and I wouldn&rsquo;t blame you either if it was on your mind. In fact, it is probably one of the reasons why you wake up in the morning when you do and go-to-bed when you do as well. For me it is why I wake up when I do, ok not entirely as I wake up earlier to run, but if it wasn&rsquo;t my next thing to do at a similar time each day would I need the alarm?</p>
<p>My profession keeps my mind on money too as it is what we are known to help protect with safeguarded controls. Also, like most companies mine is no different where a part of year-end bonus are tied to financial performance and metrics (money).</p>
<p>Personally, I am sure I am like a lot of people that in their own way have certain struggles with money. It might be big challenges to overcome or could be something small but in the end, each person would probably say if only we had <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more!<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Then everything would work out and all would be right in the world.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so :) … I don&rsquo;t buy that response as I know I have said it before, so don&rsquo;t worry you are not alone.</p>
<p>Now I would love to say I have all of the answers and that here are the 5 things you can do to turn this around and never think about money again… but that isn&rsquo;t possible as I think no matter what situation you are in you still think about it to a degree but each person is looking at it from a different perspective.</p>
<p>The bigger question is probably <!-- raw HTML omitted -->what are people&rsquo;s relationship with money?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Now I know that sounds like a really big question and well it is. It is really what drives you to do what you do, or live like you do every day. Another way to think of it would be what is your end goal with the wealth you have accumulated or might accumulate? You could be one of the fortunate ones at the end of your journey and figure it all out but I am going to guess that is only a small number of people. I would take a guess that most people are on that road right now and it might not always be clear what direction you are going.</p>
<p>This is where my journey starts/started not long ago was that I realized I had not fully defined my relationship with money in my head. In fact, it was also that I didn&rsquo;t have any short-term goals attached to a larger one. I was just doing what the system told me when I left college. I got a good job and put money away for retirement.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So my question for you to think about is, what is YOUR relationship with money?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>That is all I have for today but let&rsquo;s keep this conversation going in the near future. I was kind of thinking once I started to write this might end up being a couple of posts in which I hope to build on them going forward and incorporate feedback from you.</p>

			 <p>I had a great post for you a couple of weeks back I was in a slump about running and getting motivated to get out and run every morning.  I was thinking now that I am back at it 100% and fully motivated it would be a great time to share but then this happened this morning:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That picture was taken well after the run, a painful shower, and three bandage changes later.  Though that wasn&rsquo;t it as I really twisted my ankle and have a couple bruised ribs (or that is what the doctor told me).  Also, my iPhone took a good fall on the pavement as I normally run with it and that was the arm that broke the rest of my fall.  Overall, nothing major was broken or damaged but I am a little slower moving today.</p>
<p>You might be wondering how this happened and I wish it was a much more glamorous story.  I was running along like normal on the sidewalk but on a rougher part of asphalt and my foot must have hit a dip wrong and my ankle twisted bad and there was no coming back from that.  I broke my fall with my hand for the most part that was under my chest.  I quickly rolled over into the grass and said some choice words to the sky as I knew my iPhone was on my arm that broke the fall.  I got up quickly as well and noticed a lady stopped in her vehicle asking if I was ok.  I said I was all good and started to jog off.  After two blocks and I knew I was dripping blood from my hand and knees I decided to stop and just walk the remainder of the way home as I also knew my ankle was tender but probably not broken.  On the walk home I realized I had a lot of pain in my chest as well which ultimately is probably bruised or cracked rib.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Sooo&hellip; stay tuned and I will still post it (probably Monday) as I might need some more motivation after I get all healed up.</p>

<p>Yes, you are correct and I included it below for you to watch again, but it is still serious.  Equal access to online information is once again under serious threat by trying to come at it a different direction.

			 <p>Another year has come and gone but not without leaving a great impact to end 35. This past year the continued theme for me was to lead a healthier life, which mostly involved me spending more time outside running, biking with the kids, and ultimately trying to stay more active on a week-to-week basis.</p>
<p>This past year my wife and I also made a big decision that she was going to take a year off from Teaching in a way to slow down our crazy hustle and bustle life. With three kids there is never really a slow moment but we thought this would help us not rush the kids out the door by 7 am with us yelling at them because they were moving slowly and tired. I will say it has been a great change for the family she has been home to get our oldest on and off the bus each day, taking our middle child to Pre-School and the being able to spend time with the youngest while the older ones are off to school. I am sure some of it depends on the day but overall she has been enjoying this change and it has allowed our family to not feel so rushed.</p>
<p>For me specifically in trying to slow down or reprioritize my efforts I have started to really evaluate where I spend my time outside of work and realized I need to start saying “NO” to certain projects/volunteering activities. While I can’t say I have really severed ties with anything yet it has been on my mind as 2017 started and I have put a plan in place to evaluate those various activities as I want to make sure I am getting the most out of my days and making sure I am spending it where I want to spend it (more on this in a future post). Also, I realized it is very important for me to reevaluate things like that as work has become more time-consuming and I still want to put my best effort forward and still find time for the other things but knowing it can’t be everything.</p>
<p>Finally, this past year was a great milestone as my wife and I celebrated our <!-- raw HTML omitted -->10th Wedding Anniversary<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. However, on a sad note last year we had to say goodbye to our 13-year-old Yorkshire Terrier <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tucker<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and our youngest child says she misses him each day.</p>
<p>Finally, as I look forward to what 36 will bring for me I am not entirely sure. One thing is for sure, though, I will continue to make tweaks to my routines, projects, and continue to work on cultivating/making time for the true friendships I have. One big thing that will happen in the upcoming year is that we are going to take a road trip from Minnesota to Maine in the late summer. It will be a two-week trip one on the road and one on the ocean. That trip could mark the beginning of yearly family road trips or the final one… time will tell :).</p>
<p>I have learned so much in the last year and I hope to continue that going forward.</p>

			 <p>The “<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->little<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->” side project that some of you may or may not know about call <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blogging Meetup<!-- raw HTML omitted --> just hit another major milestone today&hellip;  It has been one year since I wrote the first post on that site as well as my own (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Community - Blogging Meetup<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) that started it all out.  I took a couple minutes to thank everyone on the site which you can find the repost below with a link to the original here (Blogging Meetup - <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Congratulation on 1 year<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I actually can’t believe it… Today marks the day that The Blogging Meetup is now one year old. I couldn’t be more excited about how it has grown and brought people together from all around the world.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In fact, I wish I could personally thank each and every one of you (383 registered users as of today) for whatever amount of contribution you have made to the continued success of this site. Even if you aren’t posting or chatting it up in the Community Chat you might just be a passive reader of the blogs listed on the site and then make sites/connections through their site. It is because of all of you that WE are still here today, as I said from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->beginning <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and I will quote it here:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Well, enough about me and back to the community! One year, I am still really stoked about that accomplishment and I hope each and every one of you are as well. I know there is things we could do better or have great visions of for this community but it will come. The one thing I have learned over the last year is that it doesn’t all need to happen right away and maybe it will someday or maybe it won’t. Now with that said, if there is something you are hoping could change or you personally would even like to change about The Blogging Meetup let me know. Post it in the comments below, include me in a post of your own on this site, direct message me on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twitter <!-- raw HTML omitted -->or you can just email me at <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="mailto:hello@ericmwalk.blog">hello@ericmwalk.blog</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I can’t wait to see what plays out in this next year but trust me I am looking forward to posting something similar when we are 2 years old :). Again, I would love to hear what you have to say or think as I am committed to having this place around for as long as people want it. I paid for another year of the domain name and will continue to do so until the lights shut off.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->One final note of appreciation goes out to Amanda, as she took an early interest in this project and has helped to do a lot of the admin work for its continued success. It looks like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->we did do something right<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as it is still kicking along!<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>&ldquo;The Boys in the Boat: Nine Americans and Their Epic Quest for Gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics&rdquo; by Daniel James Brown is a book I honestly probably would have never read this book if it wasn&rsquo;t at the suggestion of my Grandma during Thanksgiving.  She had mentioned two books she thought everyone should read and this was one of them.  Most of the time I read fiction books of mystery and suspense.  However, this non-fiction book proved to be more of a page-turner than the last couple books I had read during the holidays.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As for not knowing anything about rowing, after reading it for a couple of nights I felt like every time I went to bed I was dreaming about rowing.  Some of that was the way the author did a great job at talking about all parts of rowing but not necessarily at the same time.  It was over the course of the book he talks about the various terms and I started to understand what the coxswain, engine room, bowman, and stern.</p>
<p>The book is entirely from viewpoint of Joe Rantz, a poor farm boy from the state of Washington who was growing up during the great depression.  The book takes you through his struggles after he lost his mother early on and then was abandoned by his father.  You can tell through the story that all of the struggles he faced as a child gave him the discipline and strength to pursue rowing once he got to college as he had never done it before.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Final thoughts, I know there was a PBS Documentary called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;The Boys' of 36&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that is based on the book that you can find on the PBS website.  I have not watched it yet but am going to check it out now that I have finished the book.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>For anyone that found the last post on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Electoral College<!-- raw HTML omitted --> interesting in any way, I felt that I needed to share this as a follow up as I stumbled across last Friday evening.  It appears there is more than meets the eye to the Electoral College as you will find out in the CGP Grey video below.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>via <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Re: The Trouble With The Electoral College – Cities, Metro Areas, Elections and The United States - CGPGrey.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>After watching the video it points out a couple more overall flaws that are part of our current system.  It is interesting to think that in the current system, in December the Electoral College could reverse the decision made by the &ldquo;Public&rdquo; (States Electoral Votes) a little over a week ago. I agree this would be bad to enact as it could cause a further divide in our country.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The current system benefits no citizen and protects no states</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of this is very interesting to point out as some of it I never knew before and honestly can&rsquo;t believe that we have a system in place today that allows it.  I do hope in the near future there are more discussions on what a modern election should look like.  I will be watching as all of this has really sparked my interest as well.</p>

			 <p>With everything else that has happened in the last couple of weeks, I managed to miss that the new &ldquo;Where the Heck is Matt&rdquo; video that launched.  I am a big supporter of the work Matt Harding does mostly because I think the overall concept of dancing in all different locations is awesome.  Even though it is only a brief couple of seconds he shows himself dancing at different locations it goes to show you how the world is not always as scary as everyone makes it out to be.  He sums it up nicely in the caption of this new video by saying &ldquo;We&rsquo;re stuck on this planet together and we need to take care of each other.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>I am not one to normally talk about politics nor do I want to bring up a large discussion of right or wrong regarding the outcome of who won.  I feel strongly that each person has a right to vote as well as vote for a candidate they feel strongly about.  However, after seeing the final results Wednesday morning, my very curious 7 1/2-year-old son had a lot of questions about the Electoral College.  Not to mention how could someone win overall without winning the popular vote.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now maybe everyone else is more versed in politics than me but I feel every election I try to remember why we use the Electoral College and what is a good way to explain when asked about it.  Yesterday, I was reminded of this great CP Grey video about the Electoral College and thought I would share it, as it really does a good job in showing why it was established as well as the potential flaws in using it today.  In fact, if you watch it till the end you will see why specific states were targeted on election night as they are every election.  Also, as a bonus, CP Grey updated parts where he gave percentages to give context after this election.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Do you feel the Electoral College is working as intended or should we just change to a popular vote where each vote is equal?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Ok after writing everything so far I have to put one political plug.  We can&rsquo;t change the results of the election and need to find a way to work together as a country.  The popular votes were still pretty close and that means a lot of us are not in agreement on some of the issues discussed during the election.  I hope in the upcoming months/year we work together as a society and address some of these key issues that seem to be bothering both sides. Finally, as the election cycle is now over I have seen lots of hate shared in my Facebook and Twitter feeds.  This is not going to help us unite as a country so I am going to try hard not to share those in an effort of not continuing to spread the hate.  I fully understand it is happening and I am not pretending it doesn&rsquo;t exist but because I want to be more focused on positives going forward as we do need to find a way to make peace so <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->#OnlyShareLove<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->(this idea was taken from my wife and you can find her little project about it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Education is something that is always on my mind as I grew up surrounded by it as well as attending school for about 16 years of my life. Fast forward to where I am today and I have three kids two of which are in the School system and a wife that is a teacher. The video below was very intriguing to me personally as I know there was a couple subjects that I wasn&rsquo;t great at back in school and still am not today <strong>(<em>cough</em> writing and spelling <em>cough</em>)</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would you choose to build a house on top of an unfinished foundation? Of course not. Why, then, do we rush students through education when they haven&rsquo;t always grasped the basics?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those areas that I was never really great at I just accepted it in realizing that that would not be my true calling. Especially since Math came easy for me I knew that would be my route going forward. However, Sal Khan has an interesting point that what if each year I would have had to continue to be at a certain level of writing and spelling until I mastered it. Would it have changed the outcome of my first career? I am going to guess it wouldn&rsquo;t as it never interested me much back then but if I was better in those areas it might change the overall trajectory of my life&hellip; Well, that is a good question and one I will never know.</p>
<p>However, I look at the education that my kids are receiving and I know it is really good but could it be better if they were challenged every step of the way or at least pushed to master the subjects they were being taught before they move to the next grade? It would take a great under haul of our current education system in order to get to the perfect place that Sal Khan describes, however maybe the education system we have today should take more steps to move us closer in that direction so we can at least narrow the gap.</p>

			 <p>Happy 10th Anniversary to by beautiful and lovely wife <!-- raw HTML omitted -->April<!-- raw HTML omitted -->!  It doesn&rsquo;t seem like that long ago when we first meet in college and well the rest seems to be history now.  However, to quickly recap here are some highlights:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<pre><code>&lt;li&gt;Traveled Internationally to Peru, Belgium, Jamaica, Canada, and Mexico as well as traveling from coast to coast of the US (Arizona, Virginia, New York, California, Colorado, Texas, Michigan, Maine, Massachutes, New Mexico, Washington DC, Indiana, Washington, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, New Hampshire, Penslivania, Missouri)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lived in two different states (Illinois, Minnesota) after growing up in Iowa our whole life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have had two amazing dogs (Tucker and PJ) that we spoiled completely until the kids took over&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have three amazing kids that are very unique in their own ways (Brecken, Madiana, and Gretchen)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bought a house that was a real fixer upper that we have crafted slowly into a house we now call home&lt;/li&gt;
</code></pre>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Thanks for a great 10 years as I couldn&rsquo;t imagine being on this journey in life with anyone else.  Also, I can&rsquo;t wait to reflect on the next 10, 20, 30 years and so on.</p>

<p>I am sure some of you have known this for a long time, that the reason most places have traffic jams/build ups are because of traffic inconsistencies.  However, C.G.P. Grey does a great job of explaining it in this video that I figured it was fitting to share prior to a Monday morning commute.</p>

			 <p>A little over a week ago we had to make the tough decision to put our dog down.  Not that we will ever know how much pain he was in but we could tell he was in pain and couldn&rsquo;t control his body as he once could.  In fact, over the last couple of months he never really came out of his kennel except for to eat, drink, and go outside when we forced him to.  Then in the final week before we made the decision he was throwing up almost every day and the accidents were happening more frequently.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My wife and I had had the conversation for probably the last couple of years but more seriously in the last couple of weeks before the day.  Tucker had been with us for 13 years, with a birthday coming up this October 24th, he was the first of our &ldquo;kids&rdquo;, and he has lived in multiple houses/states.  It was a really tough decision to make that I think looking back my wife and I didn&rsquo;t really realize how hard it would be in the week(s) after.  We believe our decision was right as we saw his health declining we didn&rsquo;t want him to suffer day to day as he had to walk up/down steps to get outside and selfishly we didn&rsquo;t want his last days to be ones where we would be angry that he was having accidents or throwing up all over.</p>
<p>As my wife and I talked about it in the weeks leading up to the day, we both wanted to be with him until the end and in our minds that was non-negotiable.  We did not want to just drop him off at a vet or humane society where his last moments would be filled scared, nervous, or anxious as he heard other dogs barking in the background.  We wanted him with us, with his sister PJ (who we have had for 11 years now), and his 3 human brother/sisters.  My wife ended up finding this local service that would come out and perform the procedure at our house.</p>
<p>On Tucker&rsquo;s final day I ended up waking up early to take him for a walk instead of my normal run by myself.  I knew it was going to be a long day of tears, sadness, and thoughts as we waited until the scheduled time late in the day.  I went to work as normal but ended up leaving work around noon and going home to take Tucker to the dog park one last time.  He used to love the dog park when he was younger and my wife and I would take him all the time.  You could see a little spark in his eyes while we were there but at the same time, you could tell he was frustrated that he couldn&rsquo;t do what the other dogs were doing.  He didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;run&rdquo; around but still enjoyed wandering around and checking out the things to jump on.  After the dog park, we went back home and I just laid on the couch with Tucker for probably 2 hours.  Honestly, I am not even sure the last time I just sat in one place for two hours and did nothing.  Then we ate dinner and I figured it was time to take him for another walk or his last walk with the whole family.  Once we got back from our walk all the kids sat with Tucker and were reading him books while he laid next to them.  Finally, around 7pm we got the knock on the door and knew it was time.</p>
<p>Tucker, you truly were an amazing dog and I will miss you dearly.  Thank you for all the times you were there for me and for making my life a little bit better/more exciting.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>All kinds of Scams are horrible let&rsquo;s just put that out there.  Because most of the time they use fear to take advantage of people in a weak moment.  The worst, in my opinion, are IRS scams because let&rsquo;s be honest no one really wants to mess  with the IRS or hear that the IRS is out for them.</p>
<p>Just yesterday I got an IRS scam call from the number (646) 981-0274 and the guy told me his name was &ldquo;Zach Parker&rdquo;.  He tried to do everything by the book of trying to strike fear into me paying them <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NOW!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  He told me I owed back taxes for trying to defraud the IRS, and started quoting the revenue codes that I was in violation of (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->which obviously no normal person would know<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).  They asked if I had a good tax attorney and then said the authorities were going to come arrest me and take me to jail for a minimum of 90 days as well as freeze all of my assets.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now stop!  I am guessing those comments alone probably scare most people into trying to work with these individuals in order to clear this up before heading off to jail in a squad car that evening.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Now if you are still on the line at this point because you are a little nervous, they will take it to the next level and tell you they will try to talk to their manager and see if they can get some approvals to get this sorted out today.  Once they come back on the line, they will tell you they have instructions for you but they need you on your cell phone as you are going to have to run to the bank to get money out (cash in fact) and then they will give you more instructions.  Also, they told me this is a conversation/topic that only both of us and his manager should know about.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wait am I in a James Bond movie, what Government Department is going to tell me to go get cash but keep my phone on me at all times.  Also, to not talk to anyone about this as it is a private matter. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Now if you ask about why the cash, they will give you an odd answer but it makes sense once you go out to the government website to report or look into types of scams.  They know people are on the look out of giving Credit Card information over the phone among other things.</p>
<p>So at this point, I obviously wasn&rsquo;t going to go to the bank as I was working and really needed to get some work done.  So I did the dreaded thing of hanging up as I walked out of my office to my next meeting.  Obviously, when I returned 30 min later I had missed 15 calls but the interesting thing it wasn&rsquo;t from the same number I originally got called from.  They actually took it a step farther&hellip;.. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->They <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->masked<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> my local police department <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->number.. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wait what! <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I want to make a point about that as that is really scary and sad because you know that would have also scared someone enough into doing what they say.  However, they didn&rsquo;t leave a message the only reason I knew this was because I did a reverse phone look up.  Let&rsquo;s be honest if the Police take the time to call a resident don&rsquo;t you think they would leave a number to call back at least?</p>
<p>I was kind of ticked at these scammers at this point going to these lengths to scam people that I decided to first call my local police department to let them know.  Also, I wanted to make sure that was part of the scam which was confirmed as the Officer said no one had called me or needed me for any reason.</p>
<p>Now at this point, I should have just stopped but was a little curious what would happen if I called back to the original number on a different number.  The first time, they answered but hung up when I asked what department of the IRS it was.  The second time they didn&rsquo;t answer and it just kept ringing.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Odd right?  Wouldn&rsquo;t you think the IRS would have a messaging service or voice mail or something?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I decided to call back from my original number and someone answered who knew me from the first time or at least my name must have come up.  I asked some questions like I didn&rsquo;t know what they were talking about from the first time but only because I wanted to hang up on them.  Then about 30 seconds later, I got the masked call again from my local Police department, no greeting or anything but saying they have been trying to get a hold of me for a half hour since a fax came over.  They wanted to know my address so they could send an officer to pick me up right away.  I asked for the person name and he said his name was Mary Ellis.  If you picked up on the fact I was addressing Mary as a he, it was because the person on the phone was trying to sound like a girl but was more than likely the exact same person I was just talking to.  In fact, I could hear the same background noise of people talking about Taxes where I am guessing &ldquo;Zach&rsquo;s&rdquo; friends were trying to scam someone else.  I told him, who was acting as the local authorities, it was interesting that they had been trying to get a hold of me for the past 30 min as I had just talked to my local authorities who knew nothing about needing me.  At that point, the person hung up, scam over.</p>
<p>During and after everything was done I obviously reported the number and any important information to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (TIGTA).  It sounds like these scams are increasing as of lately for an unknown reason but remember most of the &ldquo;scam&rdquo; points I was noting above are noted on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->IRS websites<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of things to look out for.  Here is another government site with a nice Infographic on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->IRS Imposter Scams<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Finally, I have included a good video below talking about IRS Imposter Scams.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Just be careful out there as the people on the other line try to make it sound legit.  I hope it doesn&rsquo;t and hasn&rsquo;t happened to any of you.  However, if it has leave a comment below as I would enjoy hearing how it went for you and if your experience was similar to my story.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A little over a week ago I was not feeling like myself, in fact, my muscles were sore like I just ran a marathon and did 1000 push-ups at the same time.  I have never had that feeling before and it lasted for quite some time which was concerning.  I actually ended up going to the doctor after day two but all they told me was that it was probably some sort of virus.  <em>Gee thanks for the help doc.</em></p>
<p>I am happy to say as of this past Monday I was back to myself and feeling 100% again.  I have never had a sickness make my whole body feel like that before and I hope I don&rsquo;t have it again anytime soon.</p>
<p>Over the past weekend (and through this week), as I was starting to feel better slowly I was reflecting on how bad I felt last week and I realized that I was really bothered by feeling so out of it that whole week.  It wasn&rsquo;t that the doctors didn&rsquo;t give me any great advice or cure and it also wasn&rsquo;t that I was worried I wouldn&rsquo;t get better (well OK maybe at one point I was a little worried).</p>
<p><strong>What was really bothering me last week was that I never stepped foot outside in the early morning to run!</strong>  There were so many times during that week that all I wanted to do was wake up earlier, lace up my shoes, listen to a favorite Podcast or new audiobook, and hit the streets. However, I never did run at all that week as I knew resting my sore body and allowing it to fight whatever virus I had was the best solution.  Thinking back about it now I think the reason it really bothered me was that I had been running at a minimum of 2-3 times per week since January 1st and I was worried that if I didn’t get back out there I might lose the motivation/habit I have created thus far.</p>
<p><strong>It is truly amazing the power of habits (good or bad ones), that once you have formed a habit over a long period of time and stray from it, it can bother you to your core.</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I am happy to report, though, I didn&rsquo;t lose the motivation/habit as of this morning I hit my 3rd run of the week which is pretty normal for me as I try to run Monday, Wednesday, and Friday in the early mornings.  That schedule has helped me create this habit over time but now that it is more of a routine I am flexible in missing a morning/day as things come up as I know I will find the time to run another day.  Trying to mentally set a schedule or number of times in a given week was something I knew I needed in order to hold myself accountable of my 2016 goal of running.  Some other tips/tricks I have found this year to which have helped to reinforce my habit, especially at the beginning was to just get out there and do it.  As much or little as I could, in the beginning, it didn&rsquo;t matter as long as I was running during the week.  Another tip I have found is to just talk about it.  I know that sounds a little silly but by talking about running with others and on this blog actually helps energize me to run again and keep the motivation as I have this other strange feeling that I would be letting someone else down.</p>

<p>Seeing how school has just started for my kids I was reminded of this video I ran across a couple years ago.  There is a lot of good points in the video to ponder about specifically how the education system is structured today and where/how we are currently emphasizing specific topics.  I agree with the presenter that there is a problem with how the education system is structured today and the priorities that they are instilling in our youth.  It is something that is easy to point fingers as I feel everyone has an opinion on how the education system should be structured and what should be taught.  That is where it starts to break down though as there is too many opinions on it.  Additionally, it is something that can&rsquo;t be fixed overnight and has a lot of moving parts to the overall educational system.  That isn&rsquo;t to say nothing should be done, I think one of the problems and solutions is to just realize that education isn&rsquo;t a one size fits all as each person learns differently, is more interested in specific topics and on top of that learn a different paces.</p>
<p><em><strong>I would love to hear what your thoughts are on Education and Creativity.  Do you feel we have an issue today or are we doing the best we can?</strong></em></p>
<p>Hope you enjoyed this presentation as much as I did, here are two of my favorite quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If you are not prepared to be wrong you will never come up with anything original&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We are educating people out of their creative capacities</p>
</blockquote>

<p>via <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Watch The Spring - a film by charity: water | charity: waterDonate - Give The Gift Of Clean, Safe Water | charity: water<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Yesterday, charity: water published the video above as part of celebrating that the non-profit has been around for 10 years now helping to solve the water crisis for 10 years.  That is an amazing accomplishment and this video takes you back to the beginning of how Scott Harrison started the company.  In fact, it takes you a bit further back to how major dots in his life which probably and ultimately led him to create the company.  Hearing his story again is always so powerful and moving and never gets old.  The whole video itself is so powerful and moving and the message is very simple:</p>
<p><strong>Clean water changes everything.</strong></p>
<p>and the organization has a simple goal of ensuring:</p>
<p><strong>No one on earth will die from dirty water.</strong></p>
<p>###Why do I care about charity: water
I have been a big fan of this organization for a while now and one of the main things that drew me to it was how transparent they were by investing/figuring out ways to give donors confidence in what they are doing.  Some examples are showing a Google map of all the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Completed Projects<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by using GPS or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Building Remote Sensors<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in order to report on the water flowing at any of their projects, at any given time, anywhere in the world.  Not to mention, the 100% model, this was such a radical change back when charity: water was started as it was the first of it&rsquo;s kind to help promote confidence that a charity would not misuse the funds it has been given for project purposes by really requiring them to figure out another way to obtain funds for Administrative purposes (e.g., salaries, office space, computers).  That idea was so powerful of a change that I have now seen it starting up at other non-profit organizations.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to see what happens with this organization in helping solve the water crisis in the next 10 years.</p>

<p>“Ultimately [finding your tribe] comes down to reaching out to people. … It comes down to putting yourself out there to find the people that you resonate with.” - Jeff Sandquist</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The podcast, during that morning run, really made me reflect/challenge why my existing connections are still very important and reminded me that I still need to do a better job of staying connected to them.  Also, it hit me that even though my life/work tends to get away from me, I still need to continue to create/cultivate new(er) connections with people that I resonate with.</p>
<p>This idea of &ldquo;Finding your Tribe&rdquo; fits nicely in a year of changes as I continue to reflect on how I want my life to look in the next year/decades to come.  Even, more importantly, it is an underlying theme that guides who, what, and where I want to spend my <em><strong>free time</strong></em>.</p>
<p>There is a lot of other good resources that Jeff points you to with links on his page so I would suggest you go listen to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->podcast<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and check out the other links and information he has.  While you are at it, consider supporting this local (to me) Minnesota Podcaster by checking out his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pateron page<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

<p>I stumbled upon this older TED talk (was recorded back in 2010) and felt it worth sharing. I think it is a topic is still very relevant today as most employers always talk about how they are giving employees great work-life balance. However, one point that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nigel Marsh<!-- raw HTML omitted --> points out is the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Certain job, and career choices are fundamentally incompatible with being meaningful engaged on a daily basis with a young family. - Nigel Marsh</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seeing how I have a young family at home I can relate how each employees definition of what Work-Life balance should be and should look like can differ drastically. As I have only worked at a couple companies through out my career, I know each has had their own version of work-life balance and I would say each had good and bad parts to it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t design your life someone else WILL design it for you and you may not like their idea of balance. - Nigel Marsh</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, I work for a company that is fairly flexible in my opinion. I won&rsquo;t say everything is exactly how I would imagine my perfect day but they value family and that helps for where I am at in my life. I think for my personal situation it is trying to balance my own definition of how I want work/life to balance out on a daily, weekly, monthly basis given my situation, job, priorities. It is a constant balancing act between all of those points which is why there isn&rsquo;t a one size fits all solution and you just need to make the most of it.</p>
<p><em><strong>What is your definition of work-life balance?</strong></em></p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Neon Fever Dream<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Eliot Peper (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->@EliotPeper<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) was a really good page turner that once I finally started I couldn&rsquo;t put it down as I wanted to know what would happen next (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I probably should have read about one month ago but kept putting it off until Monday night<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).  This is another book of his that I can&rsquo;t recommend enough as I have tried to read every one of Eliot&rsquo;s books since he first published Uncommon Stock: Version 1.0 a couple years back.</p>
<p>In full disclosure, I was fortunate enough to receive an advance copy of the book a while back.  However, at this exact time, you can&rsquo;t read it yet but can Pre-Purchase it.  In fact, even though I received the advanced copy I still decided to purchase it as well.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The story starts out by getting you acquainted with the characters over the first couple of chapters to give you a good backdrop of the main character so you get a sense of her background.  Then everything is turned upside down in an instant with Asha and as a whim of trying to take control of her own life she ends up heading to Burning Man with her new best &ldquo;friend&rdquo;.</p>
<p>However, just when everything seemed to be getting on the right track, Asha realized she doesn&rsquo;t know the people she is with as well as she thought and she needs to quickly figure out who to trust and who is telling the truth.  Once sorted out is only the beginning as the bigger story of a criminal take down brings more twists and turns to the past of hers and the people she decided to trust.  Each page will make you question if she is trusting the right people from her current situation or her people from her past from long ago.  Will they still be able to take down the criminal empire?  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(Come on I can&rsquo;t tell you the whole story here, check it out yourself, trust me it is worth it.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Most of the story takes place at Burning Man, which I have never been to and not sure I ever will in my lifetime.  However, with Eliot&rsquo;s style of writing, I felt like I was there.  With my little understanding of the event and layout, I really did feel like I was walking or biking around the playa visiting the various places.  In fact, one specific part of the book detailed out the author&rsquo;s thoughts on the event that shows you the amount of detail he added:</p>

			 <p>I was on a good streak for a while there, at least it was a good streak for me.  Then June came and went and it is almost halfway through July and I really haven&rsquo;t written much on my site at all.  That is not to say I haven&rsquo;t posted anything as I have made a point to post something every week for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wordless Wednesday<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I have actually found this task enjoyable as I search through all of our old photos (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->172,939 as of 07/20/2016<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) and find something I feel is interesting to share.  Then I try to remember/figure out where I exactly was when I took the picture.  I really should expand on my photo searching topic and write more about the full experience instead of a caption.  Lately, I just haven&rsquo;t found the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->time<!-- raw HTML omitted --> motivation to write much more than a caption so it fits perfectly into how I have adapted the Wordless Wednesday.</p>
<p>Spending all of this time searching through old pictures it does kind of allow me to procrastinate other tasks like actually writing something, reading, or finishing up some work (as the day job has been busy too).  I won&rsquo;t discredit the fact that I might be procrastinating a little bit I do feel that even though summer seems like a great time to reflect, think, and motivate yourself to write/blog I feel it does the opposite to me. It does give me time to reflect, think but it instead motivates me to do other but more family-focused as my wife and kids are out of school for the summer.  Then oddly enough I probably have more things to write about as I am thinking/doing more stuff in the summer, I have found the lack of time/motivation at the end of the day to sit in front of the blank white screen and just type.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Has anyone else found it harder to find the time or motivation to sit down and write during the summer months and if so why?  Or do you find that it is easier to write in the summer months and why?  Just wondering if I am the only one.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>It has been a really crazy past couple of weeks probably month as I look back and I am still trying to digest all of what has happened.  To give a little background a couple of weekends ago my 4-year-old daughter had her very first dance recital on the same day we celebrated my son&rsquo;s 7th birthday with all of our family.  It is always good to have our family in town for these events as it always seems we never see each other enough and these events are a great way to force us getting together.</p>
<p>Then Sunday came and I found out that a college friend of mine had passed away from a brain aneurysm (he was 34).  He was at home visiting his family and had some headaches.  He finally went to the ER but at that point, it was too late.  Then later on Sunday, my wife&rsquo;s cousin and her husband had their third born who was a beautiful baby girl.  However, as we all knew prior to the birth the baby was going to be born with a hole in her heart and her time was going to be very limited to hours, days, or if lucky a couple of weeks.  So as expected but something we were all secretly hoping would not happen, the child passed away the following day.  I was glad that my wife was able to make it down to Iowa and visit her but honestly it was still hard to process that the parents only had less that 24 hours with their baby.  As a father of 3, it was hard to think of only having 24 hours with any of my three kids let alone even the 7, 4, or almost 2 years that I have had with each respectively.  To the parents credit, based on the pictures I saw of the child&rsquo;s 24 hours on earth, they made sure to use/spend each one of those hours to the fullest holding the child, giving it lots of love and attention knowing/not knowing when their time would be up.</p>
<p>The weekend of the funeral, my wife and I attended while our kids were hanging out with my parents.  Typically we don&rsquo;t shield death from our kids as it is something that happens and we they have lost a Grandparent (my wife&rsquo;s mother, my mother-in-law) in their short lifetime. In this case, it is something that they didn&rsquo;t need to see as it was hard enough for me as an adult to see such a small child less than a day old, no bigger than a doll, in a casket.</p>
<p>Tragic events like that really make me stop and think how short life is sometimes and you never know what is around the corner no matter how much you plan.</p>

			 <p>It has been more than three weeks since I have finished the book titled <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The More of Less: Finding the Life You Want Under Everything You Own<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Joshua Becker and honestly this was a book I really couldn&rsquo;t put down after I started it.</p>
<p>Before I tell you about the book specifically I want to point something out, I had originally started with only the Kindle version and was enjoying reading it at nights before bed but I realized that I only found limited time to pick it up every night as it didn&rsquo;t fit with my normal routine of reading/listening to things.  So I decided to upgrade my purchase to the audible companion which was well worth it as I could listen to the Audiobook during my morning run, or while cleaning up and getting things ready in the evening for the next day.  However, the biggest benefit was that I could then pick up my Kindle and actually physically read the book right where my audio portion left off.  Honestly, the best of both worlds and I would recommend it for this book as I can see myself reading and listening to it again in the near future.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Now onto my thoughts of &ldquo;The More of Less: Finding the Life You Want Under Everything you Own&rdquo; by Joshua Becker.  For someone like me that has just stumbled upon this concept of minimalism, I still really hadn&rsquo;t figure out what it meant and assumed that this book was going to tell me how to throw away almost everything I own.  I quickly realized by Joshua&rsquo;s definition of minimalism it didn&rsquo;t specifically talk about &ldquo;physical things&rdquo; and in fact, I feel this is a much better definition than what people think.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Minimalism: the intentional promotion of the things we most value and the removal of anything that distracts us from them</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After reading that definition in the book it dawned on me as to why he titled the book &ldquo;The More of Less.&rdquo;  Through the book, he explains this from his own personal story of why he wanted less as well as through the stories of others which are great examples of how The More of Less can take on many forms.  In fact, you quickly realize there isn&rsquo;t a wrong answer or a right way, you just need to figure out your own <strong>WHY</strong>.  It is a tough question that takes some time to figure out and I honestly believe it might change as you go.  It has for me at least.  Once you start formulating it in your head, it should become clearer as to the actions you might want to take in order to get you on the right track.  That track is again where this book is great. Joshua does a great job laying out various examples of what you can do to take those next steps after the why.  In fact, most are simple steps to get you started, and nothing life-changing like selling/getting rid of everything you own.  Now I had started some of this process of removing less value-added things in my life (I call it decluttering) before I read the book but one of his super simple ideas to start was to keep your car clean.  Why that is so simple that it hadn&rsquo;t even been on my mind yet and with 3 kids your car quickly becomes overtaken with &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; all over.  So that night after reading that part of the book I cleaned both our vehicles out.  Now after 3 weeks it is still cleaner than before because it is easier than before and every time I get into my car I just feel that much better.</p>
<p>That was just one example of the many that are touched on in the book.  Honestly, when I got to the last page I was just finishing an early morning run and I was a little sad that the book was over.  There is so many useful examples/thoughts that Joshua put in there and I enjoyed hearing all of them as they continued to shape my thoughts.</p>
<p>I would definitely recommend this book to everyone as I think everyone can find pieces/parts of the book that will relate to their lives no matter what your own personal situation is.  Joshua Becker has also written some other books, has a blog where he captures his thoughts as well at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Becoming Minimalist<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and also has a 12-week course titled <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Uncluttered<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>I really can&rsquo;t say enough great things about Kirby Ferguson&rsquo;s work as I have written about it before (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Everything is a Remix<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Everything is a Remix Remastered and Kickstarter<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). However, he put together a new remix video around how Star Wars The Force Awakens is just one remix after another.  As always Kirby does an excellent job researching the topic and then putting the story/details altogether.  If you enjoyed his other videos this one will not disappoint either.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now if you are like me and enjoy Kirby&rsquo;s work you might like to know that he is trying to produce more of these mini &ldquo;Everything is Remix&rdquo; videos but he needs your help.  So he has created another <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kickstarter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> project to hopefully help raise some more funds to tackle projects like these through the rest of the year instead of creating projects for other organizations.  He has already met the Kickstarter goal of $5000, which is great news because people can snag a really cool shirt and help support the project.  However, with 22 days to go, the hope is that should allow enough time to try to help him reach at least the first stretch goal of $20k so he will have the funds necessary to produce another addition to the Everything is a Remix series.</p>
<p>Obviously, I would encourage everyone and anyone that found the original series interesting to back this current project or more specifically check out his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Patron<!-- raw HTML omitted --> site to fund more of his work ongoing.  I have been following him for quite a few years now, I mentioned before and am definitely going to throw some more support his way.</p>

			 <p>A &ldquo;little&rdquo; side project that some of you know about, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blogging Meetup<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (formerly Bloggers Meetup), got some great news when it was featured on Wordpress&rsquo;s own Daily Post article talking about &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stay Supported with a Blogging Group<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo;.  That was very exciting news for me and my co-founder <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Amanda<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the project.  For what started out based on some comments in a Blogging 101 course back on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->February 19, 2016<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, is starting to really grow, grow, grow.</p>
<p>It is always a great feeling to know that something you have created is actually working, bringing people together, and having people find the end result useful.  In the same time, I hope <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->every member<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the Blogging Meetup is just as excited as we are as it couldn&rsquo;t have been done by ourselves.  It is every one that participates, encourages, supports each other, and talks to others about the Community.  Honestly, it would not/could not exist without all of the members doing those things or keeping conversations going.  Even if you aren&rsquo;t someone that participates in an active discussion on the site, I am guessing/hoping every now and then you have used the Index to find a new blog or clicked on someone&rsquo;s Blog liked on the chat page.  Participation doesn&rsquo;t need to be always commenting on the site as discovering other blogs is a big part of the whole experience.  That is where the Community effect comes into play and that is why I feel like we are doing something right.</p>
<p>So I want to give a big <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CONGRATULATIONS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and virtual <!-- raw HTML omitted -->HIGH FIVE<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to everyone that has been, is currently, or in the future is planning on being involved in the Blogging Meetup Community.  This is still only the beginning as we continue to grow and try to figure out what works, what doesn&rsquo;t, and the bigger question of what&rsquo;s next.</p>
<p>One final note, I think there is a huge opportunity in the near future for the community to help support people taking the On-Demand Blogging U Courses.  We have bloggers of all different types/skills in our community and as I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wrote this morning<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the Blogging Meetup, a big factor I joined those courses was for the Community.</p>

			 <p>Seeing how it is getting close to that time of year again for College Graduations, it reminded me of this video I saw a while back where <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chris Sacca<!-- raw HTML omitted --> gave an awesome Commencement speech to the Carlson School of Management back in 2011.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What’s success anyway? Is success about making the most money? No, money for the most part turns people into jerks.&rdquo; - Chris Sacca</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is so many good words of wisdom in the video that I wish I could have heard that exact advice when I was leaving school.  However, fast forward to today and I think the advice is still valid and the points that he is talking about are applicable no matter where you are in your life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It all comes down to Happiness.  Happy people get jobs, happy people create, happy people win, happy people fall in love and raise family&rsquo;s, they lead and change the world. Happy people get what they want because often happy people realize they don&rsquo;t actually need much more than what they have and appreciate what they got.  Happy people are contagious.&rdquo; - Chris Sacca</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would really suggest you watch the whole video as there are a lot of good quotes and thought-provoking topics he touches on.  Four of the points stuck out to me as they are still so applicable today with everything happening in the world and how technology is continuing to change the way we do things and interact with people.  In the simplest form his words of advice and ultimately a way to be successful is <em><strong>Be Present, Be Helpful, Be Ethical and Be your Weird Self</strong></em>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Another one of my favorite quotes from the video was that around GPA as I also share the same view-point as him.  Hope you enjoyed the video.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Your GPA only matters to people who have no other reason to find you interesting.&rdquo; - Chris Sacca</p>

			 <p>Lately, I have not been finding the time to write much on here or even remember to post something that I have found interesting.  However, that is not to say I haven&rsquo;t started a bunch of different posts from time to time (this is one of those).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Today after looking back and removing a couple I still have 24 different draft posts waiting for me to either look at again and finish my thoughts or probably just delete them because I don&rsquo;t know what my original intent was.  Since most of the time, my blog is just about random thoughts and things that I find interesting it is easy to quickly capture it in a blog post for a later point in time with the &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Press This<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; bookmarklet.  Also, if I have an interesting thought I want to share I can jot down a couple of notes and then pick it back up when I find time.  Since the theme of my blog is less of a daily journal and more of a place I keep interesting things and thoughts, I never feel the need to have a specific real-time event to post or something that happened to me recently.  Particularly, because most of what I do on a day-to-day basis probably isn&rsquo;t the most exciting and it would kind of get repetitive though I know there are moments in each day I will cherish.</p>
<p>With so many Drafts started you might be wondering why I don&rsquo;t find time to push the publish button more often and I think the reason is frequency.  A lot of times, a week will go by when I have lots of thoughts and interesting things I find and then there will be weeks I don&rsquo;t have as much to say or share at all.  My problem is the times that I have a lot of things I don&rsquo;t want to overload my blog with 10 posts in a week as I know the next week I might not have anything.  My intention is then always to posting some of what I found the next week or sometime after that, but it never really happens.  Hence, it would be smart of me to schedule some posts to automatically be posted out in the upcoming week(s).  One of the reasons I am hesitant to do that is that I keep thinking I might find something more timely relevant that I want to share and don&rsquo;t want to post too frequently.  Another reason is that I really like to hit that publish button even though it gives me multiple chances to review and re-review that probably take away more time than necessary to get my thoughts published.  I am still trying to work on a sustainable habit of writing/posting.  I am trying to find a groove that works but sometimes I feel like I have thought block and can&rsquo;t think of much to say or don&rsquo;t really want to share anything I have already.  I have thought the scheduled posting route might be worthwhile but haven&rsquo;t taken the plunge on it yet.</p>
<p>If you have made it this far thanks for listening to my random thoughts and of course I have a question for you.  <strong>I am curious to find out how other people manage their blogs in terms of scheduling, frequency, and/or surplus of drafts?</strong>   Also, for bonus points do you have a goal in mind as to how many posts you try to write/share in a given day/week/month?</p>

			 <p>I stumbled across these videos a while back and forgot to share them as they are really amazing, especially if you enjoy skiing.  In fact, the videos don&rsquo;t seem really fitting anymore since all of the snow was gone long ago in Minnesota.</p>
<p>However, my Brother&rsquo;s family and my parents are out in Colorado this week skiing and while talking with them last night it reminded me that I had these videos in a draft post from a while back.  Watching these videos really makes me want to hit the slopes as it reminds me and makes me miss the time I used to spend skiing with my family in Colorado and Utah. It seemed like for a while there we used to go every year over Christmas break as a kid.  Not only did those trips create my love for skiing but thinking back it was a time that we got away from our normal day-to-day school (or work for my parents) with the only care (or care I had) was being the first and last person on the slopes every day.  Then at nights we just relaxed by a fire, played board games or watched TV.</p>
<p>I am always reminded of that tradition whenever I see pictures of mountains or other people skiing.  It is just amazing how those triggers bring me back to even my first time skiing in Colorado when I was in 5th grade.  Now that I am thinking back to then, I will see if I can dig up some old pictures to share another time, but until then enjoy these really awesome videos.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Finally, if you made it this far, is there a place you used to go as a child with your family that when watching a video, looking at someone else&rsquo;s pictures, or even just talking about something remind you of that time?  I would love to hear about the place and what seems to trigger that memory the most.</p>

			 <p>It was one of those perfect nights outside earlier this week when the moon was really bright making it super easy to go on a longer run when my first thought was to keep it short as I had some work to get done.  However, the glow from the moon and the warm weather was just too perfect to pass on the opportunity to complete my Virtual 5k for the upcoming #Run3rd 5k event I signed up for.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now you are probably asking, as I was 2 years ago, what the heck is a virtual running race and what difference is it than just going out on a run and completing a 5k?  Honestly, there isn&rsquo;t much difference unless you want to feel that extra push to complete a 5k and make it act like a race.  The thing that really appealed to me about this specific race was the already strong presence of a community around this #Run3rd theme.  The concept has been out there for a while so with that drove a good turnout in year one as people wanted to be a part of the Virtual race and as they finished they would share their experiences on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Facebook <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twitter<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  The other positive of just a virtual race in general for me is that I didn&rsquo;t have to travel anywhere and didn&rsquo;t have to give up my weekend as a normal race would probably last all morning with events and registration.  The actual race they have is on Saturday, April 2nd in Mesa, Arizona and it seems like as of today you can still register for the actual event or virtual one (<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.run3rd5k.com/">http://www.run3rd5k.com/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<p>Now you might be wondering what this #Run3rd movement/community is and instead of having me try to explain it I would suggest you go read about it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and/or watch the video below, which is really the mission statement and tells a good story.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I run 1st for myself, I run 2nd for my family, I #Run3rd for you.&rdquo; - Sean Astin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The thing that drew me in was that I felt like where I am in my life today I align with the mission statement of #Run3rd.  I just had never thought of it that way but it does put some things into perspective.</p>
<p><em>PS - One cool benefit even doing the Virtual #Run3rd 5k, if you are on the fence about it, is that you still get a finisher medal as well as a cool t-shirt.</em></p>
<p><em>Edit: Here is the cool shirt and medal I got for the 2016 run and I can&rsquo;t wait till next year!</em></p>

			 <p>My thirty-fifth birthday has finally come after what has been a unique year, to say the least.  I am actually not one to really talk about my birthday so this is kind of a rare post as I am actually admitting to when it is.  Part of my reason for doing it this year is I feel like going forward it would be a good place to reflect on the year instead of marking my year on Jan 1st when most others would.  So without further ado&hellip;</p>
<p>This past year, I found myself traveling to Germany for the second time in my life and China for the first for work.  Traveling to me is something I enjoy but with a young family, all kids under the age of 6, it makes it harder to be away from home often.  On top of traveling internationally, my wife and I attended a wedding in Seattle without kids and spent a couple of days before touring around.  It was a great way to break up the normal flow of life with little kids.  I wish I could say we came back more refreshed than ever but with the wedding festivities and just touring around, we might have been more exhausted after our trip.</p>
<p>Being in a new job for most of the year and traveling more than prior years made the year seem really busy and go by fast.  Not to mention, in my free time over the summer months I was trying to build a deck, which in the end fast forward to this year, it has already paid for itself by the amount of time our kids have spent playing on it.</p>
<p>The year, of course, had ups and downs like anyone would expect.  It is a bummer how certain personal things played out throughout the year but honestly looking back now I think it was probably for the best.  True friends are still true friends even when you don&rsquo;t see them.  Also, it can&rsquo;t be always a one-way street because people have different lives sometimes, kids vs no kids, traveling job vs not traveling, owning a house in the suburbs vs living in a downtown apartment.  It bothered me for a long time as a friend of mine couldn&rsquo;t understand the situation I was in but honestly, I probably didn&rsquo;t always understand his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(I will post more on this another time)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  That probably consumed more of my energy/life over the past couple of years than I am willing to admit.</p>
<p>In January, I decided to make a commitment as I was approaching 35 that I needed to start living healthier but more specifically I wanted to start getting in shape to get into better <!-- raw HTML omitted -->habits<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and feel better all around.  With almost 3 months of these changes, I know personally and physically I am in a better place today than a year ago today.  I could probably expand that to the last 10 years.  In fact, I have lost weight, not that I am a heavy individual, but it was a weight that I probably should have never put on but has been holding constant for the last 5-6+ years.  I am hoping by continuing I will lose more and get back to the number I remembered but if not I am feeling really good about where I am today with the age I am today.</p>
<p>Looking forward, I really don’t know what’s around the corner for this year but I do know I currently like the direction I have ended my 34&rsquo;s.  It will not be easy,  there never is a year that is but I am looking forward to the challenges it will bring.  I will continue to make tweaks to my routines, projects, and friendships.  In the end, I know I am very blessed with what I have today, a loving wife, 3 amazing kids, a job that keeps me busy (and pays the bills), and some fun projects that I get to work on and meet amazing people.</p>

			 <p>I was telling my wife last night about how running at night sometimes plays tricks with your mind.  Most of the time it is when someone suddenly comes up out of nowhere and is walking/running at you, behind you, or just someone in the shadows of their house porch coughs or starts talking to someone on the phone.</p>

<p>It is funny if you ask me what bliss is it would all depend on the day, time, and what I was thinking about at that moment.  In fact, it would also probably depend on what I was doing the hours leading up to the question.  The thing is there are different things in my life that are blissful.  On the one hand, like the picture above it is a breathtaking picture of some secluded place or a picture from the top of a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mountain<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or seeing one of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->7 wonders of the world<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or just a picture of my family having fun enjoying the little things in life as well as the company of one another.</p>

			 <p>Now in the second week of March (playing catch up), I thought I would give a quick list of some Podcasts (and favorite episodes) that have been keeping me company while running in the evenings.  My favorite part about all of them is that you can subscribe to them in iTunes, which makes it super easy to pull the next one up when you are heading out on a run or long car trip.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This Week in Startups<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Jason Calacanis (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->@jason<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) - The show is done twice per week where the host Jason has various entrepreneurs on talking about their companies, what they do, and how it could change the world.  Also, every couple of weeks there is a news roundtable where he has two guests on that talk about some of the big tech topics out there.  In January, one of my favorite shows to listen to was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->E614 where Jason was talking to the CEO Emily Kirsch<!-- raw HTML omitted --> who Co-Founded <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PowerHouse<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  The conversation was very interesting as it touched on what some new companies are doing along the lines of Solar and how Solar is becoming cheaper and one of the major roadblocks they run into is Policy.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Tim Ferris Show<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Tim Ferriss (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->@tferriss<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) - This is a great podcast and Tim has some really great guests like Edward Norton, Chris Sacca, Shaun White, Naval Ravikant, and Seth Godin.  Note all of those were just in the month of January and February.  Each of those people was probably my favorite episode of the last two months and I won&rsquo;t dive into it too much as I wrote a little bit about Naval Ravikant&rsquo;s interview in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->prior post<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Intentionally Wandering<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Jeff Sandquist (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->@jeff_wandering<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) - This one was created by a local Minnesota guy named Jeff Sandquist.  I really like how the podcasts are normally only 20-30 min which is perfect to listen to the whole thing in one sitting (or run as I prefer).  The other neat thing about this podcast is that it revolves around this same theme of Intentionally Wandering and, in my opinion, sharpening your own focus on how you view your world and the world around you.  He brings in some very interesting guests as who also do a great job of making you think and sharing their experiences.  In fact, I really like how he ends the episodes with guests the same way by asking them the same question that I always try to answer myself after each one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What is your why?  Why do you do what you do?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I should probably start writing my own answer down to see how much it changes over time.  Another nice thing, since I am normally out running when listening to podcasts, is how Jeff puts show notes on the websites about the episodes with links to find the other materials (books/articles) that were mentioned in the show.  One of my favorite recent episodes is a solo episode he did titled &quot; Lessons Learned from Being Curious<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot; and there was a quote in there that really stuck out to me as I can see myself in this quote sometimes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We are all born curious, but not all of us remain curious. Curiosity, while it does come naturally to all of us, it can easily be suppressed, lost and destroyed, depending on our environment, our upbringing, our experiences, and even our thoughts and our reactions and emotions towards this idea of curiosity.” - Jeff Sandquist</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what are you waiting for go check out some of these podcasts today!  Also, do you have any that you listen to frequently?  Let me know in the comments.</p>

<p>Here it was 9:30 pm at night and I was just going to quickly finish writing a blog post I had started a couple of days back, but I was stuck and it felt like it was taking me too long to write.  It wasn&rsquo;t just flowing out like some of the ones last week did.  Then I realized that it is getting pretty late and I <strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->really<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong> wanted to get a run in tonight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>So&hellip;. I went for a run.</strong></p>
<p>During my run, I reflected on how I have been having so much momentum with this blog and I should have just finished that blog post since I haven&rsquo;t made a post since last Friday.  Once I completed my run, feeling refreshed and motivated, I was reminded of a quote about why running appealed to Bernd Heinrich who was being interviewed in a video series titled &ldquo;Why We Run&rdquo; (video is at the end of this post).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It appealed to me because I could do it all the time where every I was, no matter where I could always run. - Bernd Heinrich</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This year as I have refound my love for running I have tried to embrace a quote like that.  I have been running on some cold days and very dark nights.  However, for me, it is time well spent and the motivation I feel from going for a run is just too good to pass up.  Now I know I didn&rsquo;t publish the actual blog post I was working on but I was stuck and needed to <strong>run</strong> away for a while.  In fact, as a result, of my run, I realized it helped motivate me to write/share something instead of having it feel forced.</p>
<p><strong>Now for a question, when you get writers' block, or writing seems slow, doesn&rsquo;t flow, or feels forced how do you get through it or refocus?</strong>  Leave me your thoughts or tips in the comments as I would love to know how you refocus.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><strong>Can someone have too many hobbies or side projects?</strong></p>
<p>That is the question I have been pondering over the whole month of February.  Also, yes I know it is ironic since this is the same month I took a Blogging 101 course as well as having this crazy idea of creating a site called the Bloggers Meetup.</p>
<p>I look back at the month and I have still continued to do things that I have wanted to do, like running, reading (or listening to book tapes), keeping up-to-date with some podcasts, and trying to spend more time with my family on the weekends instead of being buried in work or side projects.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However, I do sometimes wonder if I have taken on too much.  It is unfortunately in my nature to keep volunteering at events, helping non-profits, starting side projects, or just trying new hobbies.  I am thankful that most of the things I do have different cycles of when they are busy and when they aren&rsquo;t so it normally doesn&rsquo;t create too big of a conflict.  However, then there are the times when my hobbies start to become more of a burden and it overlaps with other projects/hobbies or just my family time and that is when it really makes me think.</p>
<p>I really starting thinking about this a couple of weeks back and even though I love all of the projects I have been doing/created, I believe I would like to take the next step and get more focused on a couple of them.  It is not that I couldn&rsquo;t continue what I am doing today but at some point when the next side project comes along that seems interesting I won&rsquo;t have any resources to devote to it.  Or I will not be as devoted to another project and at that time, it might be one I would like to be devoted to.</p>
<p>So this year in my year of changes, I am going to try to make sure I keep tweaking my focus on things.  That is not to say I will drop everything tomorrow or even next month or within the next year.  I am going to start by looking at what projects/hobbies I carried forward from 2015 and make a list of why I am doing each and what I hope to continue to gain by doing them.  Some are very obvious to me right now but others are not.  As I am not sure what my longer term vision of doing it is.</p>
<p><strong>How about you?  Do you have any hobbies or side projects that you have been doing for a while that you need to take a closer look at the why?</strong>  I would love to hear your thoughts.</p>

			 <p>I have been in a couple Blogging 101 courses over the last couple of years and I have enjoyed them as they push me to continue writing and more importantly, I always stumble upon a couple great sites that I frequent well after the course is done.  One of the things I always enjoyed about the course is the sense of Community.  You had people of all different blogging/WordPress expertise working together and helping each other out along the way.  I was in a course a little over a year ago and was thinking wouldn&rsquo;t it be great to continue the conversation after the course was done?</p>
<p>Now I know you could still visit people&rsquo;s sites and make comments and suggestions.  However, by only doing that you never get a chance to ask questions?  You could end your post with a question but what if your question was about WordPress specifically, or a Theme, or just anything else that is random but doesn&rsquo;t really fit as a blog post on your site for people to respond to?  Also, that is assuming you have a magnitude of followers that actually see that post on a given week/day.</p>
<p>As I was in February 2016 Blogging 101 course, it was on my mind again about how could we do this.  I have seen it done before but most of the time they wall it off with a Private Site and then it makes it hard for people to even find it or know what it is about unless you stumbled upon it by someone else&rsquo;s post.  Also, there were blogs I started to follow that continued my thinking about this little project.  One specifically by Amanda titled &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->It Matters<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;, which it really resonated with me and I suggest you read it as well now.  Ok, now that you are back.</p>
<p>Insert, the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bloggers Meetup<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, where what finally pushed me into starting this was based on a simple post I read in the Blogging 101 course where a couple of people were asking what will happen next after the course is over.  I saw it as a time to recruit these people who had the same interest as myself in creating an Open Community where Bloggers could come and go and just chat with other bloggers.  You can read more about my initial thoughts on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bloggers Meetup<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as I don&rsquo;t want to republish the whole thing here (also this is getting long right?).  However, I would encourage any of you to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->register<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the site and then I hope to see you chatting with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Community<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Also, since it is just starting up feel free to throughout your ideas of how to grow or what you would like to see it become.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to thank everyone so far for registering and showing interest in this Community project.  Not to mention some of the first people who reached out to me like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@Amanda<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@AmeenasMusings<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, who have really helped get things off the ground there.  I can&rsquo;t wait to see what is next for all of us!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I finally got around to catching up on some blogs and podcasts that I listen to late last week and I realized that two of them seemed to be touching on the same topic, &ldquo;<em><strong>Habits</strong></em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Now each of them talks about it from different angles but both have made me reflect on the habits I have been trying to break this year.  Or even more specifically some of the good ones I am trying to create this year.  Some people might say well that really sounds like a New Years' resolution, but for me, it is more of a time commitment change in focus that will be ongoing.</p>
<p>This brings me to the first blog that has been actually talking about it all year.  The site is called Break the Twitch and it&rsquo;s creator <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anthony Ongaro<!-- raw HTML omitted --> does a great job of framing this up in his post a while back called &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->How I Created Daily Action Steps to Achieve My 2016 Vision (And You Can Too)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;.  There is actually a lot of good stuff in there about helping you create a vision for 2016 and follow through with it.  However, based on how I have been changing my habits this year the following quote resonated with me best.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To eliminate a bad habit, we first need to establish a good habit to take its place. - Anthony Ongaro</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then as I was running last outside last week and listening to The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tim Ferriss<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Episode titled <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Naval Ravikant on Happiness Hacks and the 5 Chimps Theory<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I would definitely suggest you listen to it as there are lots of good nuggets of information in that podcast.  For me, the reason it really stuck out again was this talk of habits and breaking habits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Learning how to break habits is an important/great meta skill. - Naval Ravikant</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He talked about the power of habits and that after you have broken a habit it helps teach you that all habits can be broken.  In fact, he said he break habits and creates new ones frequently.  One tip he had to break habits is a daily workout as he suggests it is very important to do some kind of physical activity at the same time every day no exception.</p>
<p>He suggests further that it happens in the morning as it will lead to better choices as you have to make sure you get to bed earlier.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree with him more on the psychology of physical activity and having it be in the morning.  For me, I have been adding a new habit this year of running but not in the morning as he suggests but at night.  This isn&rsquo;t the most ideal, and it does lead to some of the same things he mentions as leading to better habits all around.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>How about you, is there any new habits you are hoping to create in 2016 and in the process remove some bad ones?  I would love to hear about your success so far or what is holding you back in the comments below.</p>

			 <p>As I was reading my email last night everything became clear just as Jason Calacanis laid out in his post the day before titled &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Knowing when, and how, to pivot (or, why didn’t news apps work?)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;.  It is a really good article and I would suggest checking it out.</p>
<p>Like many people, I have a couple different news apps on my phone, maybe you don&rsquo;t and, in that case, lucky you.  Why so many you ask?  I use them strong for a couple of months and then I stop using them on a daily basis as I go back to where I always go to look for things social Media.  Yes, just as the article said, &ldquo;News apps failed because social networks succeeded&rdquo;, which couldn&rsquo;t be truer.  I check Twitter first to see what is going on and read/consume most of my news/articles there.  However, it is not to say I am not open to finding a better way to consume news because as I mentioned I have a couple of news apps on my phone but that is where they are, on my phone and I don&rsquo;t do everything on my phone.  However&hellip; My email is with me on my phone, tablet, and laptop and it is that running to-do list of things that are waiting for me to look at anytime/anywhere.  Now maybe my habit of email has gone down over the years, as I don&rsquo;t check it every 5 min, but I would say it still ranks pretty high on the usage ratio.</p>
<p>That is where these Newsletters are killing it these days because you are already in your email and you don&rsquo;t have to open yet another app.  Here are the top four newsletters I get every day that I always seem to keep opening:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Final side note on News apps, I installed NextDraft app on my phone but never really use it because the email is so perfect for my routine as it is in a place I already look and can access it anywhere.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on News Apps and do you think one will really stick around?  If you are a frequent user of one let me know what your favorite one is as I am always game to try new apps.</p>

			 <p>I am not one of those people to ask others for things. Specifically, in my career I am good at what I do but when I want to make a role change or find out about an opportunity from someone I end up dragging my feet and most of the time miss out on the opportunity. I tried to do better over the past couple of years but still it is something I am uncomfortable confronting people about. However, for those times that I have stuck my neck on the line it has been worth it even if it didn&rsquo;t end as I would ultimately hope but, at least, I didn&rsquo;t have to think I just missed out.</p>
<p>Today I was again reminded that it never hurts to ask. I have thought about my career path at the company I am working at lately. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong what I am doing now is fine and I don&rsquo;t mind doing it but I keep thinking in 10 years I don&rsquo;t want to be doing the same thing. Also, as I have grown more in figuring &ldquo;Life&rdquo; out the last couple of months I realized I really would like to do something different.</p>
<p>On the same lines, I am reflecting back on an email I sent to a CEO that I have run into from time to time over the past 3 years. The company he works at had a job posted that I was interested in, I didn&rsquo;t think I was qualified and kept dragging my feet for weeks. However, I finally found the courage to ask him if he would mind chatting about it which within an hour he emailed me back the name of the CFO for me to email as well copying himself. In the end, my thoughts were right, they wanted someone with a little more experience but I feel a lot better knowing it wasn&rsquo;t just a missed opportunity.</p>
<p>Do you have any times in your career that you wished you would have spoken up to find out about an opportunity? Or did you have a time that you did speak up and how did it turn out for you, I would love to hear your thoughts, leave them in the comments below.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t born to just pay bills and die.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My wife sent me this quote the other day and it really made me reflect on things so I thought I would share.  I decided to put that quote on a photo I took while hiking with a good friend in Colorado a couple of years back.  In fact, my wife bought me the plane ticket to go see my friend for my birthday and looking back it was a great present as it got me to do what I had been talking about doing since I left college but kept saying to myself I was too busy.</p>
<p>I was more out of shape back then as I hadn&rsquo;t gotten into the swing of running again but it was well worth it once we made it to the top.  It was a gorgeous day and the view from the top of Estes Cone was awesome.  Luckily, the trail we took, which started at Longs Peak Trailhead, wasn&rsquo;t too strenuous and I would suggest it to anyone that finds themselves in the area.</p>
<p>Here are a couple other pictures I took from the peak, hiking up, and from the base of the mountain to give you a feel for how high up we were.</p>

			 <p>Yep, I was the person outside in Minnesota on January 9 when it was -4 degrees running around the streets.</p>
<p>However, since then the weather has been mostly above 0 when I go out on my runs even though most of the time it is around 9:30 pm.  Honestly, I wish I had a better time to do it but I have tried to create a habit in 2016 of running and I tell myself that if night running is my only time, then night running it is.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>###Some Background</p>
<p>Now, for fun here is a little background on my running, I used to be a runner back in High School (long ago) and loved running, still do, but I lost the actual urge to run as I fell into a busy trap.  I could find lots of excuses after college, heck even in college.  I ran off and on my Freshman and Sophomore year just as something to do as at that point I wasn&rsquo;t too buried in the books.  However, I took it up a notch the summer before my Junior year as I conned my brother into running the Twin Cities Marathon with me in October.  I ran ever day all summer no matter what and sometimes 2x per day.  However, once school started up in the fall I never really found time to run as I made excuses.  Never fear, though, I was young and determined to still run the Marathon and I actually finished with very little walking.  However, since that day I have always made excuses and let the excuses win.  I would try from time to time but never keep the momentum.  In fact in spring, summer, and fall of 2015, I think I went on a couple weeks worth of running and then stopped.  Part of my problem I found was I wasn&rsquo;t making the right choice or prioritizing my time correctly and my excuse was always that I could never find the right &ldquo;<em><strong>time</strong></em>&rdquo; to run.</p>
<p>###Starting over again</p>
<p>Fast forward to the start of 2016 and something clicked.  It might have been some of the changes in my life that occurred in 2015, or that I wouldn&rsquo;t mind losing a couple pounds, or maybe I finally remembered that I love running and gives me time to think.  I am honest with myself in knowing that I will not run every day but I would like to run a couple times a week.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is something great about running as it is just pure.  You can only move as fast as you can, as far as you can, and as long as you can.  However, it is all up to you to determine what you &ldquo;can&rdquo; do and what you get out of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me right now I am not worried about the distance, or speed, or length as I just enjoy putting my shoes and going for a run, even if it is below 0.</p>

			 <p>I can&rsquo;t believe I missed the announcement that Everything is a Remix by Kirby Ferguson was remastered and all four parts were put together in a nice single video.  I stumbled upon Everything is a Remix a couple years ago and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wrote<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about how great the work was back then.</p>
<p>However, besides the remastered version of his project, I was even more shocked to see that Kirby was running a Kickstarter again for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Five Year Anniversary of Everything is a Remix<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Now, this is where it gets even better, there is a bunch of cool rewards out there and if his project makes it past $20K (at $15K at the time of writing this), he will start work on another Everything is a Remix project.</p>
<p>So watch the video below, and then contribute to his <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kickstarter project<!-- raw HTML omitted --> so we can get another great video on this topic.  Then browse some of his websites like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Everything is a Remix<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and his other project he has been working on called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is Not a Conspiracy Theory<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Honestly, how could you not be a fan of Kirby&rsquo;s work as he does amazing research and puts that together in an awesome video story that captures your attention?  Also, don&rsquo;t forget to follow him on Twitter <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@remixeverything<!-- raw HTML omitted --> so you can keep up-to-date on his current projects and anything else.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2015/08/05/uncommon-stock-exit.html">&#34;Uncommon Stock: Exit Strategy&#34; by Eliot Peper</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2015/08/05/uncommon-stock-exit.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2015-08-05 08:46:00 -0500">Aug 5, 2015</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The final book in the Uncommon Stock series hit the shelves on July 29, 2015 and if you were like me you had already pre-ordered it so it would be instantly sent to your Kindle.   </p>
<p>If you missed the launch of the Part III, don&rsquo;t worry you can pick it up from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Amazon for only $4.99<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (it is a steal).   </p>
<p>Trust me you will not be disappointed with Part III, just as the first two books were well worth it.  Now if you haven&rsquo;t read them yet I would suggest you read all three in order (here is my take on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Part II, Uncommon Stock: Power Play<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<p>I was really excited to see how the whole journey of Mara and James unfolded in this book and it was too perfect that it hit the shelves right before I had a long trip to China.  I started reading it on my long flights and wished I wouldn&rsquo;t have had other things that kept distracting me along the way.</p>
<p>However, since the team I was with never went into work until 8am I had plenty of time after waking up at 4am, as I wasn&rsquo;t able to sleep any longer, to continue reading.  The only bad part about that was I didn&rsquo;t want to put it down when I knew it was time to catch the cab.  Also, it helped that domestic flights in China seem to be delayed often which allowed me to finish the book and write this posting.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Now onto Exit Strategy, the story puts you right back into the fast-paced life of the Mozaik startup roller coaster.  </p>
<p>Eliot does a great job keeping your thoughts focused on wondering what Mara is going to do next and how are they ever going to take down Maelstrom.  Not to mention you are captivated by the underlying story about Mozaik, the company you have been rooting for since Part 1.  He does a great job walking you through some of the real-life examples of the pains that Startups go through from the beginning all the way through IPOs.  Honestly, this is one of those books that touches on so many topics that it probably appeals to people that like all kinds of books from mystery, suspense and action. Then to top that off it is about this Startup company trying to catch people involved in financial fraud, murder, and deception.</p>
<p>Now I could probably write on and on about what happened but that would just ruin the fun of reading it.  So I will at least give you a couple of my favorite quotes/sayings from the book that stuck out to me.  I think each of these just go to show the amount of information beyond being a good story is packed into this book and more specifically this series.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The short version is that when you lay good code on top of bad code, the result is still bad code.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You can&rsquo;t wait until you had enough time for exercise. You had to make time for it no matter what.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Economics, the science of explaining tomorrow why the predictions you made yesterday didn&rsquo;t come true today.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is something ephemeral but infinitely satisfying about starting something yourself.  Your shit is on the line and you and your team are where the buck stops.  If you get a kick out of that, then you end up having few other employment choices.  If you&rsquo;ve got that bug, you essentially have to start a company or get involved with startups.  Otherwise, your brain starts to rot and you get all bitchy and miserable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, at the end of the book after it is all done (don&rsquo;t worry I am not going to spoil the ending) but Eliot Peper hinted at coming out with a new book (not part of this series) in Spring of 2016.  So if you are like me and enjoy his style of writing you probably should following him on twitter (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->@EliotPeper<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) and subscribe to his newsletter from his website (<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.eliotpeper.com/">http://www.eliotpeper.com/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>

			 <p>This isn&rsquo;t going to be the post you are expecting for an introduction as I am really going to talk about why I am taking another Blogging101 course.  However, for those of you that are new to the site, I encourage you to find out more about me by reading my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->About<!-- raw HTML omitted --> page.  So the question is why am I taking yet another Blogging101 course?  The answer is actually pretty simple and you can read why below.  Also, if you are like me and a returning Blogging101 student I would be curious to know why, so let me know in the comments section below.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Giving back by Helping others:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
This is one of the biggest reasons I signed up again to do the Blogging101 course this session.  The last session I made a point to try to search out and find people needing help or having questions on how to do certain things in WordPress.  I actually have a couple different sites that I have helped maintain over the years for Non-Profits, Businesses, and just friends/family members' personal ones.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Forces me to Blog, Learn, and Network:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
It should be easier to make me blog than having to sign up for a course.  However, with everything else going on in life it is not always the first thing I remember to do.  By having the daily reminders to do something on my site helps remind me that I should also start writing something (even if it isn&rsquo;t published that day).  Also, by doing the daily tasks each time, I have learned something new by trying new things and reading/seeing what other people try.  Most importantly the networking part kind of goes with my helping others as it makes you feel part of a community.  However, by signing up it allows/encourages me to find people who are writing about things that I am interested in, and that in turn encourages me to write more as well.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Traveling:
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can see where this one is kind of odd one to put down.  However, I am currently traveling in China for work, in fact, I just landed in Shanghai last night.  Then after I get back to Minnesota for a couple of days before my wife and I head to Seattle for one of our good friend&rsquo;s wedding.  So I thought signing up for this course again would be good as I should have some time to blog during my downtime at hotels, airports, and on airplanes.  Who knows I might even come up with a couple of tips on traveling as we go.</p>

<p>This episode with Stephen Colbert is really good and I just had to share.  Unfortunately, you can&rsquo;t actually embed any of the videos from the site so you will have to click on the link below to watch it.  Don&rsquo;t worry it is well worth it.</p>

<p>I found this cool trailer for the whole Season 6 of Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee that is actually pretty good and seems like there is some other takes here that weren&rsquo;t in the actual final cut.  If you have some time to spare I would actually suggest watching the whole Season if you haven&rsquo;t already.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>At what point is it unreasonable for a previous employer to continue asking questions of you?  I was gone for over 4 months and I still receive questions.</p>
<p>I feel as though I am a reasonable person and tried to everything right by my previous employer.  In fact I even gave them over a months notice that I would be leaving the company.  In all the time I was a manager people only gave me a couple of weeks notice and then I had to scramble to back-fill that individual.  Also, I never remember calling anyone after they left the company to ask how something was done, that was what I had to figure out before the individual left.</p>
<p>In the end though, I always try to exceed people&rsquo;s expectations and I did continue to provide answers to some of their questions as time allowed in the evenings.  Mostly because it is in my nature to be helpful and I didn&rsquo;t really see any reason to burn bridges of the people I worked with for 7 years over a couple of questions here and there (I can say all of this now as I haven&rsquo;t had a question for 3 months).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For a longer read, I will give you more of the back-story as I have not really talked about why I ended up looking for a new job.  It isn&rsquo;t that I have anything bad to say about my previous employer and in fact I enjoyed everyone I worked with and had a great time learning along the way.</p>
<p>Over a year ago the company I used to work for announced it was going to be merging with another company.  It was an exciting time for the company but also left a lot of people worried about what was going to happen.  Honestly, I was never really that worried, I figured I would get an offer to stay at the company doing what I was doing or I would go somewhere else.  In the meantime, before the deal could close there was going to be a lot of work done as I worked in Finance and needed to assist all 3 companies involved.  Budget models needed to be created and vetted out before too long so it wouldn&rsquo;t be done last-minute.</p>
<p>Information was very slow to come from our company about what the future was as far as Corporate location and the big unknown&hellip; Jobs.</p>
<p>As I suspected, I was offered a similar position to what I had with increased responsibilities but that would require me to move out-of-state and away from my family that lives here in the Midwest (this happened about 3 months after the announcement).  I didn&rsquo;t really like that option and at the time that was the only option they had available for me.  I was completely up front with them and said at this time I did not want to move but I realized that my job would no longer be in Minnesota after the company merged.  At that point I made sure they knew I was going to start reaching out to other companies and told them I would continue to be open and honest about what I was thinking.  They confirmed my thoughts on my current position by saying they are sorry I wouldn&rsquo;t take the offer.  Also, they wanted me to know that my job wasn&rsquo;t going away on day one and they would try to find something else before then.</p>
<p>About 4 months after the offer I went back to the same individuals and told them that I had found another job and was giving them my month notice with a couple of conditions attached.  The reason for the conditions was mostly because I knew it would be helpful to them if I stayed until January and in turn that could help me so I could spend a week watching my 2 young girls and working here and there that week.</p>
<p>Looking back how the whole process went, I think the lack of communication was the biggest downfall from what I could observe.  There was too much unknown for people and some of the people willing to stick it out were asked to leave at a later day due to synergies.  It didn&rsquo;t help that on top of that a good handful of the upper management were not sticking with the merged company (where most people were going) and were either retiring or going with the new company.</p>
<p>Another question for anyone that has made it this far&hellip; Have you had an experience with a company merging of equal size and or spinning off a portion of a company, if so how did it go?</p>

			<h1><a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2015/07/07/all-house-projects.html">All house projects are not created equal - Replacing interior Doors</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2015/07/07/all-house-projects.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2015-07-07 10:31:47 -0500">Jul 7, 2015</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Replacing interior doors in your house should not be a hard task to accomplish.  Just measure the rough opening, purchase a new door that should fit in the rough opening, and then install the new door in a matter of minutes.  However, if your house is like mine and you had previous owners like me you will understand why there is nothing &ldquo;easy&rdquo; or &ldquo;standard&rdquo; when it comes to house projects.</p>
<p>To spare you the long story I will jump right in that I needed to replace the downstairs bathroom door and jam (frame).  Should be an easy task right?  Think again.  I quickly realized after taking the door and molding off that the rough opening of the door was not even close to a standard size but yet they somehow took a standard door and shoved it into the opening they had.  Very classic for my house and I really shouldn&rsquo;t have expected anything less.  So that left me with two decisions:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Once the frame nice and snug in the rough opening it was time to cut the door down to size as of course it was too tall.  Now this is not as tough of a task but since I was using hollow core doors it added to the challenge as I was taking more than 2 inches off the bottom.  Which means that the bottom of the door would have been left open as I would be cutting the entire filling piece off.  Since this had already happened to me before for some closet doors I replaced I already had a solution.</p>
<p>In order to make a nice cut and not chip your wood up to much I would suggest putting a line of painters tap on both sides.  You will probably still have some chipping but it will help reduce it.  After you make the cut you will want to clean out the spacing foam/cardboard to make room for a new cap.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you have the right materials around you can cut a new piece of wood for the filler.  If that is the case make sure you are measuring from the outside edges and not the center of the hole.  Otherwise, another option in a pinch is to use the old filler from the part you cut.  However, it takes a little bit of work pealing the outside paneling away without breaking the cap.  Either way works as I have done both before.  Finally, to secure it in place I would suggest using glue and then tack it with a brad nailer.</p>
<p>Here is the finished product which tuned out nice after spending about 2 hrs more than I had hoped to.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Follow-up:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> So after writing all of this I decided to see if anyone had a video of a similar process that I took of cutting the hollow-core door.  I was in luck as Rick Arnold published a video on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FineHomeBuilding<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that is pretty much identical to what I did. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Finally got around to putting some real thoughts into the book I read a while back called “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Uncommon Stock: Power Play<!-- raw HTML omitted -->” by Eliot Peper.  I actually got and read this book right around the time it was published back in November/December but things started to pick up at my old job and I never got a chance to put the rest of my thoughts in writing about the book.</p>
<p>The book is very captivating as it is about a Startup company that gets caught up in a money laundering scheme.  One of the great things I like about this book is that it discusses real issues that I have heard founders face in Startups today, which is then mixed into the suspense of the characters lives.</p>
<p>Eliot&rsquo;s style of writing is very engaging and hard to put down.  However, if you do have to <em><strong>HAVE</strong></em> to put it down because a child is crying or children or fighting it isn&rsquo;t hard to pick right back up where you left off.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Overall, it is a great book and I would suggest picking it up from FG Press since at only $4.95 for a digital version it is a steal.  Then why you are there you might as well pick up the Uncommon Stock book in the series titled &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Uncommon Stock: Version 1.0<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; as it only costs under five dollars as well.</p>
<p>Finally, Eliot is planning on publishing another books in this series this year titled Uncommon Stock: Exit Strategy, which I can&rsquo;t wait to read.  To make sure you don&rsquo;t miss out and are in the know on his upcoming book you should probably following him on twitter (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->@EliotPeper<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) and subscribe to his newsletter from his website (<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.eliotpeper.com/">http://www.eliotpeper.com/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>

		<a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2015/02/25/thoughts-on-medium.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2015-02-25 13:46:37 -0500">Feb 25, 2015</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>For the last couple of months, I have been more interested in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Medium<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as some of the writers/bloggers I follow have been cross-posting to there. It is actually a very interesting platform as it seems to attract people who want to write longer articles and don&rsquo;t really have a personal site to do so. Also, since it is a place that houses a collection of public writings from various people on various topics it allows people who don&rsquo;t get there writing exposed to the masses a better shot of getting more exposure.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However, with yesterday&rsquo;s post by Founder Ev Williams titled &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->A Less Long, More Connected Medium<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; it starts to make you wonder what new audiences this will draw to the platform. Before you didn&rsquo;t see many people post short posts on Medium as there wasn&rsquo;t that Feed as you would find on Twitter, Facebook, or Tumblr. However, talking more specifically about Tumblr it seems as though that might be the targeted audience as you can continue to write longer posts/writings that people are more accustom to in Medium.</p>
<p>As I was thinking more and more about the shift in new features I was reminded of an article that Hunter Walk wrote a couple of years back titled &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ev Williams’ Medium is Blogging for the 9%<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&rdquo; In there he talked about the internet rule of 1%-9%-90% and equated to WordPress, Medium, and Tumbler respectively. As I do believe that is still true I am wondering how much of a shift will happen with the new Feeds and Shorter posts that may or may not start occur on Medium going forward.</p>
<p>Time will tell and it will be interesting to see how it plays out. I wonder if by allowing shorter posts will lead to less fully original content (as Hunter Walk attributed to Tumbler in his article) on Medium and create more noise on the platform than before. In fact, it might make it harder to find the rich stories/articles that were once easier to stumble upon.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on the change to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Medium<!-- raw HTML omitted -->?</p>

<p>From the title of this video you are probably thinking you have read a number of articles about how you can find fulfilling work and why would you waste you time watching one more video.  However, being someone who has worked at different companies in various roles I think this advice is more spot on than the rest.  It isn&rsquo;t necessary saying anything different but pointing out you aren&rsquo;t always going to get it right and more importantly it is going to take time to get right.</p>

<p>This video is actually a little dated now but I just stumbled across it and figured I would share.  It has been a while since I have actually watched the original <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Back to the Future<!-- raw HTML omitted --> movie but I was able to track with this 1 min Speedrun pretty well.  Really great work by by the creators 1a4studio.  Also, if you are interested they have some other Speedrun video&rsquo;s out there that you might want to check out as well.</p>

			 <blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re either the <strong>author</strong> of your own book or a <strong>character</strong> is someone else&rsquo;s.&rdquo; - Christian Macy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is one of my favorite quotes and I encourage you to watch Christian&rsquo;s entire Ignite Boulder presentation as the whole thing is really good.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As the first full week of 2015 is coming to a close I couldn&rsquo;t help but think this quote was perfect as I started a new job on Monday of this week.  I am not starting a job in the way that Christian describes it in the video, as I gave my previous employer about a month&rsquo;s notice and wrapped up all my outstanding tasks.  However, my new job was really me taking control of my career as the other options in front of me I wasn&rsquo;t as excited about.  So I decided to take that step outside of my past 6.5 year comfort zone and I found another company that I could get behind, enjoyed the people I met and hopefully I will be able to do great things for.</p>

			 <p>I can&rsquo;t believe I missed the video below as it practically happened in my own backyard. However, you have to watch this video of 5th grader Cordell Steiner giving a TEDx presentation at the University of St. Thomas about the benefits of video games in the classroom to further students learning. First of all, how impressive that he stood up in front of the audience and gave such a presentation.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You can tell that Cordell is very enthusiastic about education through failure as it is just as instructive as classroom success. He makes some really good points in the video and it is refreshing hearing a kids perspective on how video games (or Apps) can really help every student learn to their full potential.</p>
<p>I think with technology changing it is only right that education and how students are taught will change as well. My son started kindergarten this year and everyone in the school has iPads. I have been fortunate to help out in the classroom on a couple of occasions and watch how the kids use the iPads first hand. Most of the Educational Applications they use could probably be considered games as they try to encourage students by keeping a tally of right and wrong answers. Also, from what I could tell most of the Apps would change automatically change the difficulty as the child answered more and more correct. There were other Apps that allowed the teacher to set a baseline of what level the student was at and she could track their progress of how they are doing by easy to view reports on her computer. They don&rsquo;t use iPads as the only way to learn as the teacher still does instruction as we all remember. I would estimate that they only use the iPads at most an hour a day (over the course of a week).</p>
<p>As a parent and technology enthusiast I actually like that they are using technology to assist and educate my child. I know for a fact that by allowing him to have some time to learn at his own pace using the educational Apps has only furthered his interest in learning by continuing to keep him challenged.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This is a very long overdue post about a book I read titled “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sleep your way to the Top (and other myths about business success)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->” by Jane Miller.  I was actually lucky enough to get a copy from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FG Press<!-- raw HTML omitted --> not long after I had <!-- raw HTML omitted -->written<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about the number of books I had been listening to so far in 2014.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Honestly, when I got the email with instructions on where to get the book I had no idea what the book was about.  Since I was lucky enough to get a copy of the book, I decided to take the challenge of reading it. It was defiantly worth my time and I would encourage anyone and everyone to read this book.  It is packed with great life lessons/thoughts based on the situations, successes, and mistakes that Jane made.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;No decision is a bad decision&hellip; if you learn from it.&rdquo; - Jane Miller</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It touches on various topics like resume writing, interviewing, being a team player, and when is the right time to leave a company.  At the end of each chapter, there are questions to ask yourself, that I believe are designed to make you more aware of your strengths and weaknesses.  Also, depending on where you are in your career you can use some of the questions/situations she poses to help you try to figure out what your dream job is and how that may or may not relate to your current job/role.</p>
<p>I wish I could have read this book when I was in college getting ready to graduate as there are some really good life lessons that everyone goes through in the world of business.  The best part is that all of those tips and lessons are embedded in a funny and captivating story.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Let me tell you something. You stupid little runt.  I own you. You&rsquo;re my bitch.  So don&rsquo;t walk around here thinking you have free will, because you don&rsquo;t.  I could crush you anytime I want.  So settle in, &lsquo;cause you are here for the long haul.&rdquo; - Dave Harkien, Horrible Bosses (film)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finishing this book was really easy, the only painful part was my lack of sleep since I couldn&rsquo;t put the book down as I always wanted to finish another chapter before shutting my eyes.</p>
<p>So if you are looking for a good book to read I would definitely encourage you to find this book and while you are at it check out Jane Miller&rsquo;s website to read other things she has written <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://janeknows.com/">http://janeknows.com/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>The weather is finally turning cold in Minnesota and that means that people are starting to think of the one sport everyone in Minnesota seems to play&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->HOCKEY!<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>For some background, I grew up in Iowa never playing or really watching hockey.  Once I moved to Minnesota after college I started watching Hockey and have even taken up skating.  It really must be something in the air or water here as my kids talk about hockey all the time and it seems to be on their mind all the time <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(Not that I am complaining)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  For that reason, when I had the opportunity to acquire some boards last year to set up my rink in the backyard I took advantage of it.  Some of my friends outside the state of Minnesota are shocked that we actually flooded the backyard to create a rink to skate on.  Honestly, it does sound a little strange but the whole family had a blast skating and playing hockey on it last year.  The best part was you didn&rsquo;t have to get in the car, or walk down the street to enjoy it.</p>
<p>Since the weather has been turning colder and there was snow in the forecast, I spent some of the weekend setting the rink up to ensure I was ready for the season.  I was lucky that some family was in town to do some of the heavy lifting/swinging to get everything setup in really good time.  Here is how it looked as of Sunday night with the Boards up, and the tarp clipped down.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There were two things I did differently from last year:</p>

<p>Below are some pictures of my helpers assisting in the setup, as you can see they had a great time helping set the boards out.</p>

			 <p>I have never really thought it mattered to me as I have had a blog for a couple years but have never really consistently published stuff.   So I used the cheaper alternative of using WordPress.org (or a self-hosted site) because I have had the server and storage space for some other projects I work on.  It works well for me and I appreciate being able to have full control of the site and can make any changes as necessary.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However, after publishing my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->first assignment for Blogging101<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I realized that there are a few differences between the two depending on what you are looking for.  Specifically for this course, I realized that my posts might not get as much attention as others since they don&rsquo;t show up in the WordPress.com Reader under the Blogging101 tag and there is not an easy Follow button at the top of my site.  Thinking about that a little more I realized that by having my own Self-hosted site I really would miss out on the community part of my WordPress experience.</p>
<p>I decided to do some more digging on finding the differences and see if there was anything out there that could help bridge the gap but I couldn&rsquo;t find anything.  In my searching thought I found a couple of useful articles:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>With that information, I was left to ponder the question that I had never really thought about before.  Which platform is better for me now?  Ultimately, I decided to buy a new domain name called StillThinking.me, which will be the blog I use going forward for the time being.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I will miss having more control over my site by using plugins and other customization.  The nice thing is that no matter which you choose WordPress.com or WordPress.org you can easily import/export to either if you change your mind down the road.</p>
<p>So what platform are you using?  Have you ever moved from one platform to the other?  What do you feel is the pros/cons of each?</p>

			 <p>In a hope to continue to jump-start my writing on this blog I decided to sign up for a Blogging 101 course through <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Daily Post<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I have blogged off and on for many years now but only seriously thought about putting my blog together about 3 years ago (that wasn’t for family travel/photo purposes).</p>
<p>For some quick details about myself check out my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->about page<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Now on to the more meaningful question about why I am blogging, what will I be blogging about.  The first question is an easy one about why/what I am blogging about since I changed how I would be using this site a couple of months back and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wrote about it<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  The short answer is I am blogging as a way to share interesting stories and thoughts.  The topics will probably be a range of things that I find interesting and will probably be clearer as I post more often so stay tuned.</p>

<p>About a month ago a friend of mine shared with me a new site he stumbled upon called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Known<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I was very intrigued as I am with most things and signed up to get a better idea of how it worked and what you could do with it.  The main use (and tagline) is to have a place for sharing content and discussing ideas.  I thought the idea is great and probably has good use for a number of people.  Then as I was going to make my first post I realized I already have a place to do that and that is here on this WordPress blog.  All of their selling points of publishing words, pictures, podcasts and sharing them with the networks you use is exactly what I can do with this site today.  So instead of having another site with just random things, I find interesting I figured I should just do that here.  So there you have it, that is why I have changed what I post and I hope you have found some of the new things interesting.</p>

			 <p>I have been spending a lot of my spare time lately <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reading<!-- raw HTML omitted --> listening to books.   So far this year I have completed 24 books (listened to 22, read 2).  I won&rsquo;t list out all of the books as it probably wouldn&rsquo;t be all that interesting but if you are curious you can check it out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I have found that listening to books is a good way to pass the time while working on various house projects (e.g., Painting the House).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Also, I stumbled upon the author <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David Baldacci<!-- raw HTML omitted --> who has some really good books out there.  The topics of his books are around espionage, war zones, traitors and good guys on a mission to contain/eliminate the problems of the people who don&rsquo;t have the United States interests at heart.  If you are interested in those types of Spy/Detective books I would really encourage you to check out the many books he has written (<a href="http://davidbaldacci.com/)">http://davidbaldacci.com/)</a>.  My favorite series so far is The Camel Club.</p>
<p>So what is next for my book reading?  I might take a little break from listening to books and go back to actually reading a couple books that have been in the queue (partially because there isn&rsquo;t an audiobook for them).   What books are you reading or any suggestions you have of good books I should check out?  Leave it in the comments section.</p>
<p>Another reason, I might slow my reading/listening to books down is I have been thinking of picking up a couple new projects in the near future.  I have a couple of ideas but need to put some more thought on what I hope to accomplish and then reach out for some advice.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This week has been busy.  The company I work for has a 3/31 year end and seeing how I am a Finance guy there is a lot of stuff happening and trying to get done before that date.  The nice thing is that my company has every other Friday off and this is one of them.  I decided to take this morning to step away from work stuff and slow down.</p>
<p>While I was having my coffee this morning and reading news I ran across an article from earlier this week by Hanna Rosin titled  &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Your not as busy as you say you are<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The answer to feeling oppressively busy, is to stop telling yourself that you’re oppressively busy, because the truth is that we are all much less busy than we think we are.&rdquo; - John Robinson</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article referenced a previous article that I had red by Tim Kreider titled &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Busy Trap<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; which I stumbled on a while back after reading an article that Brad Feld wrote called &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Have You Fallen Into The Busy Trap?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;  Check all of them out if you have time as each are very interesting but in the end the message is the same that everyone seems to be creating their own sense of busyness.</p>
<p>With two kids (ages 2 and almost 5), both my wife and I working full-time, we are busy.  However, it is true that some things we bring on ourselves and they really shouldn&rsquo;t be considered the busy part of your life.  Work is busy because it is work and I don&rsquo;t want to focus on that too much but you are probably working at the job you are for a variety of reasons.  Outside of work the things you do (e.g., volunteering, social gatherings, kids activities) you shouldn&rsquo;t have the mindset that all of that is making your life too busy.  In fact what you choose to do on the weekends and at nights are optional.</p>
<p>For my wife and I, we understand it is good to have kids involved in things but we don&rsquo;t want extra activities taking up our kids lives or ours.  So we have allowed them to each sign up for one activity which could either be at nights or on the weekends.  We feel this is important as we don&rsquo;t want them to be so involved in outside activities that they miss just being a child.  The same thing is true for being an adult, you don&rsquo;t want to miss out on spending quality time with your family, friends, significant other or maybe having a couple of hours to yourself.  You need to make sure you are not so busy with scheduled events and activities that you can&rsquo;t just slow down and enjoy the present.</p>
<p>There is some families we know who have their kids in every activity possible which is good for them.  However, I don&rsquo;t feel bad for them if they tell me they are so busy with work and the kids that they can&rsquo;t do anything else.  If the parents are saying that how do you think the kids feel?  I mean they are never at their house to play with any of their own toys or just do interesting kids stuff.  I remember as a kid having lots of down time to do whatever I wanted and that was even being in lots of activities as well.</p>
<p>Tim Kreider said it best at the end of his article which I have modified to portray my own thoughts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it’s possible I’ll lie on my deathbed regretting that I didn’t work harder and say everything I had to say, but I think what I’ll really wish is that I could have one more beer with friends, another long talk with my wife April, read one more story to my children, and have one last family gathering.  Life is too short to be busy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now with that said I just called up my brother and am going to meet him for lunch.</p>

			 <p>If it&rsquo;s a deadline, email, phone call, blogging, or working out everyone has something they procrastinate about and always say, &ldquo;I wish I could do better.&rdquo;  So, what is the &ldquo;Seinfeld Strategy&rdquo; and how does it work you are probably wondering.  The advice that Jerry Seinfeld gave to Brad Issac (<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->LifeHacker<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->), who wanted to be a better comic, was simple, &ldquo;Write everyday and don&rsquo;t break the chain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More specifically this is what Seinfeld told him to do:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&ldquo;Get a big wall calendar that has a whole year on one page and hang it on a prominent wall. Then get a big red magic marker. For each day that you complete your task of writing, put a big red X over that day.</p>
<p>Then after a few days you&rsquo;ll have a chain. Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day.  You&rsquo;ll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job next is to not break the chain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I actually read an article published by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->James Clear<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> from <!-- raw HTML omitted --> The <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Huffington Post<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> six months ago which referenced the same story and had his own take on the matter. I remember telling myself I needed to get back to writing as it has been an area I would like to improve on in my older/wiser years. Well, fast forward six months and I saw the same article written again by James Clear but for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Entrepreneur<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>That reminded me that I had this blog post started from back then and I never did complete it or follow the advice at that time.</p>
<p>However, this time when I read the article I was reflecting on how I have been using the &ldquo;Seinfeld Strategy&rdquo; by writing more and more each week (I finally started in January).  Not everything I write gets the publish button pushed, but nevertheless there is writing being done so that I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->don&rsquo;t break the chain<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>I felt like she made a great correlation between how hobbies assisted with gaining real world knowledge.  If you ever want to create something new or be an entrepreneur start with what you know, the best way to do it is to find something you have a passion for.</p>
<p>Take the 5 min and watch her presentation and if you are a &ldquo;Geek&rdquo; it will defiantly be worth it.  If you aren&rsquo;t, well it will still be a good listen for 5 min.</p>

<p>Ran across this picture today and found it to be fitting with how most Plans and Planning goes compared to what the reality.  However, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you should forget about planning because you just want to roll with the punches.  In fact the picture above should remind you of the opposite.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail!&rdquo;  - Benjamin Franklin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remind yourself that a plan is never set in stone and problems/issues will most likely present themselves during the execution process.  When unforeseen issues arise you should use that time to reevaluate the current plan/outcome and make modifications as necessary.  How you handle those issues will prove to be the ultimate success or failure of the outcome.  You might find that what you thought you wanted as an outcome is not the best anymore and you will be glad you reevaluated it during the process.</p>

<p>I am going to publish this post about awkwardness&hellip;. and keep going.  What a great video that came from Ignite Boulder21 by Banks Benitez (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->@BanksBenitez<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>

<p>One of my favorite quotes in the video is the one he shares from Dr. Seuss and for some reason really hits home with me as it reminds me very much of my wife and I as we are both weird.</p>

			 <p>I stumbled upon Kirby Ferguson because of the TED Talk video that was posted a few days ago.  I would encourage you to watch the video as it really starts to make you think about copyright laws.  One of my favorite quotes is &ldquo;Everything is a Remix, until you are the one getting remixed.&rdquo;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>via <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TED: Kirby Ferguson: Embrace the remix - Kirby Ferguson (2012)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Part 2 of my Post</p>
<p>After doing a little more research on <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kirby<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Ferguson<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I ended up watching a couple more videos titled Everything is a Remix, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Part 1<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Part 2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Part 3<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Part 4<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from his site <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Everything is a Remix<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I am still shocked that the opening to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stairway to Heaven<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Led Zeppelin was copied from Spirits song titled <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Taurus<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I guess it goes to emphasize one of Kerby&rsquo;s quotes that says &ldquo;Creativity isn&rsquo;t Magic, it happens by applying ordinary tools of thoughts to existing materials&rdquo;.  Also, another one of the quotes that is pointed to a specific company is &ldquo;When we copy we justify it, when others copy we vilify it.&rdquo;  In addition to the videos described above he recently had a Kickstarter video project funded earlier this year titled &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is Not a Conspiracy Theory<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;.  Even though the KickStarter project is closed and fully funded, I would encourage you to donate to his work from his website if you think the videos <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Every Thing Is A Remix<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, were as interesting as I did.</p>
<p>As I too have not created anything new by this post, I would like to again re-quote something from the videos, &ldquo;I invented nothing new.  I simply assembled the discoveries of other men behind whom were centuries of work.  Had I worked fifty or ten or even five years before, I would have failed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keep up the good work Kirby and I look forward to seeing more of your work.</p>

			 <p>A couple weeks ago we went to the zoo and took our Cannon Digital XLR camera along as we always do in order to capture pictures of our kids.  However, after a full morning of taking pictures we got home and were going to load them on the Mac when we got a lovely message that the camera card needed to be reformatted and no pictures were found&hellip;</p>
<p>WHAT!?</p>
<p>I was sure that was a mistake, so we plugged it into a few other machines but each one said the same thing. For my family we love to take pictures and have been doing it for a long time.  About 8 years ago we went to Peru for vacation and took 100+ pictures a day for each of the 14 days we were there.  So after realizing that the Card was &ldquo;Really&rdquo; not working right I started looking for any type of software that could help recover our pictures from the day.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say if you want to check and see if you have a chance of recovering anything you can easily do a quick Google search and find a lot of trial software.  I ended up installing a few of them from companies that I felt I could trust.  The nice thing about most of the trial software is that you could run the SD Card recovery and get a preview of the photos it found before you had to purchase the full version.  In the end we bought the eSupport.com product called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Undelete Plus<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and were able to get all of the photos back from that day.  In reality this seemed like a lot of the other products but I liked that this one can restore more than just pictures and videos like the other two I was reviewing.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Update:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->After this issue happened we decided to use our old CF Camera card we purchased at the same time as our camera.  Also, we just got back from a 2 week vacation of taking pictures with no issues.  I think in looking back the issue relied in the CF Card Adapter as we had previously tried to replace the SD card.</p>

			 <p>I just wanted to start off again by saying this shouldn&rsquo;t have taken as long as it did but it wasn&rsquo;t of the highest priority over the past three years.  Not that I didn&rsquo;t want to get it done but when owning a house that needs fixing up, you have to tackle things one at a time, which normally means 10 projects going at the same time.</p>
<p>If you have never done any projects like this before it is defiantly a learning experience and I am not sure if I would have been able to do it without the help of the internet (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->YouTube<!-- raw HTML omitted --> specifically).  In fact, come to think of it there is so much information/tutorials out on the internet it is surprising what you could probably put together without really starting with much knowledge of a process.</p>
<p>I think the biggest thing I learned through the process is that when you are trying to remake something you always run into 100 more unforeseen problems. One of the biggest scratch-your-head moments was when I was ready to put the Sheetrock back up and on the vanity side, a pipe was sitting farther out than the studs. I have no idea how that was even possible since I didn&rsquo;t replace or move that pipe or the studs. Needless to say, I had to run to my local Home Depot and get the thinnest boards I could find in order to space the Sheetrock out another 1/8 of an inch. However, there were other issues I ran into as well, which required me to rerun all the electrical in the room causing some delay once I knocked down the ceiling, or replacing a rotten floorboard (wonder if the floor or shower leaked for the previous owners).</p>
<p>Overall, I actually do enjoy working on projects like this and seeing everything come together in the end.  Additionally, I am frugal with my money when it comes to things &ldquo;I could do&rdquo; or as my wife puts it things &ldquo;I think I can do.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>So it has been over a month since my last post but for good reason. My daughter (second child) was born not long after that so that has been keeping me a little more occupied that normal.</p>
<p>With this wonderful delay in my life, it additionally allowed me to give my homebrew some additional time to sit.  Now that I had a few moments to spare I finally decided to give it a taste.  I might be bias but I think it turned out pretty good for my first time back at it.  In fact, I was able to taste the hint of Maple Syrup in the beer.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I have been wanting to brew another batch of a different kind but I haven&rsquo;t found the time to do that yet.</p>
<p>However, just because I haven&rsquo;t found the time to do any other homebrews don&rsquo;t think everything has been put on the back burner.  I have still been working my project but it is still not quite where I would like it to be.  I have finished a house project of redoing the master bathroom as well as painting our master bedroom (I will put more pictures and time in an upcoming post to show the long process).   Then to top it off, things have been really busy at work lately as well as another person in our department has decided to leave.  However, I can&rsquo;t fault her since she is not moving for a better job in town, she is moving to be with her boyfriend out in California because he got a job out there.</p>
<p>Well time to get ready for another work week.</p>

			 <p>Two things that I have been devoting my time outside of work on these days, besides my family as well which we are expecting an addition to arrive any day now.</p>
<p>I have been working on this side project from time to time for quite a few years now and it has just finally taken a different direction as I have always wanted it to.  I apologize that I am not giving out all the information now but I am still working pretty hard on it to get it to a finalized state so it is usable by the time my customer needs it.  Additionally, I feel by writing it quickly on a Monday morning I will not give enough details in to who this project came about and some ideas I have for the future of the project.</p>
<p>It has been about 4 years since I brewed beer more frequently and I have finally gotten around to picking the hobby back up again.  I decided to grab a kit in December from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Midwest Supplies<!-- raw HTML omitted --> called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Maple Syrup Dark Ale<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Lets just say that day was a learning experience as my first batch (yes I had to do two), I was rushing to much and not checking the size of my boiling pot.  Needless to say I did it a second time paying close attention to all the details and I am hopeful this batch is going to turn out good.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>On January 8th moved it from the carboy to bottles and am now just waiting patiently to see if it turned out good or if I am going to have to pour all the bottles down the drain.  If this one and a few more turn out good, I will post a few tips and tricks that I have found useful to anyone wanting to pick the hobby up.  However, I have to wait to post them to ensure the tips and tricks I remember produce the beer I remember.</p>
<p>Well that is all I have for a Monday evening.</p>

			 <p>So much for trying to keep up with this blog as you can tell from my previous posts.  I guess I have been busy with life in general and other random things.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, I have been working on this other project that I have made a lot of progress on but can&rsquo;t seem to get the client to agree to the final part.  This has made me put that project on hold for the last couple of weeks which has actually worked out well and has given me time to to help a non-profit in Iowa with a couple of things.  Also, I was able to prepare for winter or really my wifes need for wanting a fire all the time by splitting a bunch of wood last Friday.</p>

<p>Finally, I have been paying more attention to the Craft Beer scene here around the Twin Cities but even in Minnesota in general and it is really blowing up.  I will make another post specifically about that as I might stop by the Golden Nugget tonight to try another some more new beers from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lucid Brewing<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>So as I haven&rsquo;t been as productive on posting anything I have actually been busy.</p>

			 <p>Ok, so how long has it been since I posted my &ldquo;first&rdquo; blog post to start this?  Let&rsquo;s not answer it as it is the post right before this and probably should be deleted anyways.</p>
<p>This week has been a very busy week both with my family, work wise and what I will call my hobbies/interests.  However, as I keep thinking about writing blog two things happen: 1) not really knowing what to put here and 2) when I do think of things things to put here I let to much time laps and never get it done.</p>
<p>Now insert the video I stumbled upon yesterday while catching up on some news titled Procrastination.  I have not read the book but here is the trailer, which hits home for me.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Next question you probably would have is what have I learned by watching the video.  To be honest nothing more than what I already knew but it did make me think about all the things in my life I have procrastinated about by doing other things first.  However, maybe with that video and other things that have happened this week, they have given me a renewed interest in my own interests that I say I never have time for.</p>
<p>I guess time will tell.</p>

			 <p>It is about time I create an actual blog site.  I used/use Postures for a while but realized that I needed something else.  Not that I was posting or using it that much that I needed to upgrade but it seems most people use that for quick posts or sharing items and still have a blog that allows them to write more.  So&hellip; this is where all of that thinking has brought me.  If you are asking yourself what this blog will bring, I am not sure.</p>

			 <p>I have realized today that it has been hard to focus on work lately as my mind has been searching else where.  However, in some emails that I received from a non-profit that I assist with outside of work I realized what developers sometime miss.  Not to make this generalized but in my experience some developers forget about the overall goal.  For instance this non-for-profit, their main goal was to spice up their website which I really think is a good idea.  However, if you asked me the second point needed to be stressed that it was easy to use.  So instead we have a nice product that is not as user friendly in the back end and I have been troubleshooting something I didn't create.  Not that I am unable to assist it is just not my day job. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well didn't mean to group all developers into that group, since I realize I have developed things.  However, I have ran into this experience a few times so thought I would share.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
