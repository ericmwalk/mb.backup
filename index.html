			 <p>Had to motivate myself to get out there <a href="http://www.strava.com/activities/7867082176">today</a> but it was really a nice day out. With one week to go, a lots of curveballs of life plans have made me worried of my overall goal or fitness. However, so close now I will just get it done with no expectations.</p>

			 <p>After having a couple of my running friends twist my arm I finally signed up for the Twin Cities Marathon again. However, it wasn‚Äôt just because of their insistent pushing me to do it but I realized that due to COVID and not having a marathon in 2020, this is the 40th year of the Twin Cities Marathon. I <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/10/04/twin-cities-marathon.html">documented</a> how I ran it last year and before that it was 20 years ago. So it should have been the 40th running last year of the Twin Cities Marathon and that would have been even cooler to say I did it when I turned 40. However, that ship has mostly sailed but there is something neat about running both the 20th and 40th Twin Cities Marathon. I might not be as trained as last time as a lot has happened this year but I should be trained enough or at least better than I was at the 20th üòâ.</p>

Only time to start <a href="http://www.strava.com/activities/7825374548">running</a> was right after a dinner on a full stomach as my family was in town. Got about 3 miles in and my backpack broke.

			 <p>Most likely the last big trip for this year has wrapped up and I am again reminded that I was going to attempt to post/record more of what happened so I would have a record of it in the future to look back on. However, as it has been almost two weeks since we got back and I haven‚Äôt posted anything from my last trip (or the first trip for that matter) except running pictures it doesn‚Äôt seem like I am going to start a new trend.</p>
<p>As I was thinking about this today I think it all comes down to I want it in chronological order on my blog and on the same day it happened. Don‚Äôt know why but that is just how my brain works. I used to be pretty good a while back at doing that and posting some daily adventures on Instagram when we road tripped to Colorado. However, I have found that harder to do over the years since then and I think some of it also comes back to having the pictures readily available to post quickly that evening. For example on this past trip to Maine, I did take a good handful of photos on my phone and it would have been probably good enough to just post that to get something of the day documented. However, I brought along our good Cannon DSLR with all of the lenses and tried my best to use it and also carried it around during the days (except when running). So I knew there were probably good photos on that too as I used it to capture moments and didn‚Äôt rely on my phone. In addition, my wife had her phone as well and took some great in-the-moment photos that I would have wanted to post as well.</p>
<p>So I waited thinking maybe the next day I would get around to doing something&hellip;. and then as the days went on I did nothing.</p>
<p>I am back to the point of wondering if I should just post a daily log that I have kept about the things we did and the places we visited. Or post the daily log and include pictures as all of them are now mostly in one place (or I can get them from my wife‚Äôs Instagram account as she does a lot better job than I). Or keep doing what I have been and doing and do nothing.</p>
<p>Time will tell but I do feel like I want a record of the event as I like looking back and seeing what we did.</p>

<p>I actually found some time to listen to it and it is amazing the various topics we touched on even though I was there to talk about <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/arcadia-arcade-watch-games/id1479608271">Arcadia</a> üòÑ. I really had a great time chatting <em>in person</em> with <a href="https://burk.io/">Jason Burk</a> (@burk), <a href="https://loungeruminator.net/">Martin Feld</a> (@martinfeld), and <a href="https://canion.omg.lol/">Andrew Canion</a> (@canion) and I want to thank each of them again for allowing me to participate. The rest of the episode after my brief appearance is great to as they continue to cover other interesting topics.

			 <p>This past weekend we went down to the Gott Family farm in small town <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie,_Iowa">Ollie, Iowa</a>. It is a little bit of a hike to get there from where we live but the kids loved every minute of it as they get to do all the things they don‚Äôt do in the cities (e.g., ride tractors, 4-wheelers, and have a personal finishing pond). I am pretty sure if you couldn‚Äôt catch a fish in this pond something is really wrong.</p>
<p>As you look though and see the size of the fish you will realize that they seemed to be well fed. Especially when the Grandkids are around.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday our dog woke up and nothing seemed off as I took her outside as I normally do. However, when we got back inside and I normally give her a treat with her daily pill in it she sniffed it and just walked away. That is not normal at all&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/eb97864848.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Doodle just looked sick as she would walk up to me while working yesterday</em></p>
<p>Fast forward a little while and she kept throwing up and then when I would take her outside she would attempt to eat more grass to throw up. We ended up calling the vet and taking her in. They were very concerned and did multiple tests which all came back good for us and later in the day she came home after some shots and we could just monitor her for the rest of the day. She only drank a little late last night but would throw up after each sip of water. The vet told us if it continued like that we should call the next morning. At midnight last night I took her out once more and she came inside and did have some water and didn‚Äôt throw up the rest of the night. I decided incase she had to go outside quick I would just sleep on the couch with her so she wouldn‚Äôt have to jump down from our big bed and walk so far to the door. Needless to say I didn‚Äôt sleep well all night as the couple of times I woke up I checked on her fearing the worst as she really hadn‚Äôt eaten or drank anything for quite some time.</p>

<p><em>Work up this morning and the doodle had moved around a little bit but still very tired</em></p>
<p>I took her out this morning before I went for a run and then she went back inside and slept on our bed and my wife watch over her till I got back. Once I got back I took her out again and once we got back inside she seemed a little more pep in her step and took her daily treat, ate the little bit of food I offered her and drank some water. Hopefully, things keep looking up today as I am not sure I can go though another night like that.</p>

<p>I think the other kids were quite jealous of the food I brought because she said <em><strong>everyone</strong></em> else‚Äôs parents bring this. Come to find out they all want it but no one brings it. üòÜ</p>
<p>It is interesting to think that she is in 1st grade and almost done with this year and I have never really been in her classroom. Some of it is she it at a different school than her siblings but also with COVID protocols the past 2 years we were never really allowed in the school much. So it was also fun for me to see where they eat lunch and the hallways she walks down every day.</p>

			 <p>I like how well the Apple AirPods just work with my iPhone. Only over the last year have I switched almost all of my personal devices back to <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/08/20/new-devices.html">Apple devices</a> and today I was reminded why it just makes sense and it just works.</p>
<p>With the upcoming weekend, I had a block of time this morning that I could get a longer than normal done during the workday. Since we are camping this weekend I wasn‚Äôt sure what the long weekend would bring.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/f8ea3bbcf9.jpg" alt="iPod Pro and iPhone 13 Mini"></p>
<p>I only got about 1.5 miles into my run this morning when I got the text (<em>that was conveniently spoken to me</em>) from our Grocery shopper that they are going to start shopping for us. <em>I am not sure why my wife put my number for them to contact but it probably works as I am in front of a computer most days and she is a teacher in front of kids.</em> However, I was able to respond easily to the shopper on her questions about substitutions for the entire run. I never had to stop once to grab my phone out and respond and I was listening to a Podcast in between the times that she would ask me another question. It was honestly just so simple to listen to what she asked me and then say ‚Äú<strong>reply</strong>‚Äù and respond with my answer. I exchanged 10 messages with her until she finally sent me the note saying she was done and I would get an email shortly. This was conveniently 1 mile before I was done and I was ok with the fact that all of this happened as I was doing something else. I didn‚Äôt have much else going on during that run but I would have been frustrated if I would have had to stop every mile and try to respond to her on my phone instead of just plugging away at the miles while <em>texting</em> her back.</p>
<p>Times when technology works the way it is intended (or maybe not intended) for me just blows my mind. Some people probably would not enjoy such a disruption as I had today but I didn‚Äôt mind it at all as I might have otherwise been stuck with groceries I didn‚Äôt want or ones I would have happily taken a replacement for but never responded to say so.</p>

			 <p>This book was just <strong>awesome</strong>! I had been looking for a book to read and this one dropped into my lap at the right time.</p>
<p>I have been a big fan of Eliot‚Äôs books in the past and this one again is not a disappointment and somehow seems to take it to the next level.</p>
<p>Due to a busy schedule of kids' activities, it took me a while to actually pick up <a href="https://eliotpeper.com/books/reap3r">Reap3r</a> and start reading it but once I did I could not put it down. The bite-sized chapters and fast-paced book kept me wanting to read more and find out what happened and unfolded next.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/9fb2a72db8.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Well, what more can I say that you should go pick up a copy when it is <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reap3r-Eliot-Peper-ebook/dp/B09PZNWKGQ">released on May 18th</a></strong>. Eliot does it again by doing a great job of keeping the book relevant enough in today&rsquo;s world in both technology, political, and environmental issues that help make a near future book seems believable and real. With out spoiling too much some of the things he brings up in the book is crazy to think he wrote those parts more than 2 years before publishing and some of the ideas and thoughts he put in the book came true üò≥. I think that is why I love his books so much. No matter how fast-paced or near future he makes the books they don‚Äôt feel that far out on the horizon of technology and the issues seem like they might be something we will need to address in our lifetime.</p>
<p>The story has many key characters that each have their own stories and at the start, you keep trying to figure out how everything is going to fit together. That is where the magic of his writing takes place as he weaves each of the characters' stories together. There are past friendships / acquaintances with secrets to hide which is how they ended up where they are today. Then there are newer characters that have created something amazing and are now being thrust into the mix and trying to put all the pieces together.</p>
<p>Not to mention Eliot&rsquo;s attention to detail throughout the book I always appreciate as I can picture the places he is talking about and it makes me feel like I am there seeing the sights and sounds. Also, how can I forget if you have read some or all of Eliot‚Äôs books you might find some tie-ins or mentions of technology, and/or people from his previous works üòâ.</p>
<p>Thanks again to my friend Eliot for providing me with an advanced copy of your book as I thoroughly enjoyed it. In fact, I enjoyed it so much that I noticed that there will be an Audiobook version that he will be doing the reading for so I have already reserved a copy of that to accompany me on some long runs in the future.</p>
<p><em>As I mentioned I have read some of Eliot&rsquo;s books before and wrote about them so if you are interested to check out some of his other books go for it as you won&rsquo;t be disappointed!

			 <p>Another trip around the sun for me as I flip my internal digits to <strong>41</strong>! As I am sitting down in these morning hours, hoping the kids will sleep in longer as they are on Spring Break, I am actually struggling what to write. It isn‚Äôt that I don‚Äôt know what to write but there was actually a lot of things that happened and I know I won‚Äôt capture them all or well enough in this entry. I am still working from home for the most part which is a blessing some days and a curse other times.</p>
<p>However, using past entries as a guide I will follow up on some things I alluded to last year and just talk about other things.</p>
<p>Year two with the RV was much like the first but a little less camping this year as we didn‚Äôt know what to expect with kids camps and stuff coming back. We never made it on a real long roadtrip but we visited a couple new places and old ones. I will say even though it is a chore getting the rig ready and cleaned out it seems like once we are at a place everyone enjoyed their time.</p>

<em>Lainey Lou the Doodle loves camping and her favorite camp chair&hellip; Sorry humans!</em></p>
<p>It was my 40th this past year I had some big things planned in the area of running&hellip;. The good thing is I did complete the <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/10/04/twin-cities-marathon.html">Twin Cities Marathon</a> that I did 20 years ago that day which was just a fun accomplishment in my mind.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/924e8a2dbb.jpg" alt=""><br>
<em>My crew really supported me the whole way with cheers.. I loved it!</em></p>
<p>However, the second thing I had up my sleeves didn‚Äôt pan out which might have been for the best. I would have had limited time in between each event so it might have made that Marathon extra hard. However, I decided to embark on my own adventure of a 4x4x40 which I then decided to complete the entire <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/21/xx-recap.html">4x4x48</a> (which involves running 4 miles ever 4 hours for 48 hours).</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/c28aac39d4.jpg" alt=""><br>
<em>Doing a 4x4x48 means sometimes you find yourself running at night in the snow/rain. It‚Äôs fun right?</em></p>
<p>It was one of those fun accomplishments that I was doing for myself and no one knew but me so that made it all the more fun. Kind of like when I ran a <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/09/30/k-a-day.html">5k a day for 365 days</a> as no one really knew much about it till the end. It wasn‚Äôt that I was hiding it but it was something that I wanted to prove to myself just like the 4x4x48. I am not really sure what this year will bring as I haven‚Äôt signed up for anything but I keep plugging along. If anything I am going to keep exploring as a good thing about being able to run further from my house is I find new places to explore.</p>

<em>Following some new to me paths in the Riley Creek Conservation Area</em></p>
<p>As I looking forward to this next year, I am looking forward to traveling again. We have a couple trips in the works for the summer that should be really fun. One with the RV and the other just flying somewhere. As a family we haven‚Äôt flew anywhere for such a long time. Additionally, I need to work some more on my ‚ÄúProject Shed‚Äù to get it in a better place to work before summer when the kids are at home every day.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt think I did much around ‚ÄúLearning‚Äù this past year and for the life of me I am not sure what I was going to do. I guess silly as it is I learned (re-learned) how to be a longer distance runner but I don‚Äôt think that is what I was thinking. This year I am still going to focus on other aspects of <strong>‚ÄúEmbracing‚Äù</strong> which has been kind of an ongoing one but more around Embracing moments. I think being kind of locked up for the last two years (which it was good to be safe) has led me to not be as outgoing as I was and I know that needs to change slightly. I think there should be some easy wins here but just need to make the <em>time</em> and <strong>commitment</strong> to do it. Probably part putting myself out there again after all this time at home üòÅ.</p>

<p>What a great way to end the season and it is sad that the season has now come to an end. It has been fun watching these boys play together. They had a very successful season (28-12) despite all the sicknesses, and injuries. As I was the official / unofficial stat keeper here are some interesting facts.</p>
<ul>
<li>1st Place in 3 tournaments</li>
<li>2nd Place in 2 tournaments</li>
<li>3rd Place in 1 tournaments</li>
<li>40% shooting percentage vs opponents 35%</li>
<li>One tournament they only had 5 kids to play (no subs) and only lost one game</li>
<li>Out of the 40 games only two kids were at all of them (one being my son)</li>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I have been collecting this data and been reading articles for some time about the discrepancies in my <strong>Apple Watch 6 vs my Garmin fƒìnix 5x</strong>. However, I have not finished all of that yet and felt compelled to post this quickly as I ran across a very puzzling issue today that I am not even really sure where to start but this is how it went.</p>
<p>On my run today I started both watches at the same time as always waiting for the Apple Watch to do it‚Äôs 3 second countdown and then I hit start on my Garmin. Today was colder out so I had a jacket over both watches so to that point I only looked once at both watches to see how the time was as I knew I needed to make a loop (or thought I did) because I wasn‚Äôt going to hit the mileage I was shooting for. However, the Apple Watch was back at the main screen and not in the Workout screen. This is only irritating as I had to type in my pin to get into the watch. I thought for sure then it must have stopped timing but this had also happened earlier in the week and once I clicked back into the Workout app I could see the time was still ticking away. I did the same thing today and glanced that it was still running but didn‚Äôt look close enough to know what the time said or anything.</p>
<p>Fast forward 1 more mile and I was at the end of my run and I stopped my Garmin first and then went to my wrist and stopped the Apple Watch as I always do. However, looking at the activity summaries I noticed the Apple Watch said I only ran a fraction of the time and distance I knew I was at.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/ea3d6c2048.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Now I have had some discrepancies before now but never such a big one</em></p>
<p>Knowing that didn‚Äôt seem right I dug into the details of the Apple Watch the GPS shows me stopping this half way through the run ü§î. I would say oh it must have just shut off but I know with 1 mile to go I looked at it and the time was ticking away so if anything where was that portion of time.</p>
<h3 id="i-gotta-have-the-details">I gotta have the details&hellip;</h3>
<p>Now as a person running with two watches I get I am a little strange but this was even more boggling than the research I have been looking into on just GPS accuracy for each watch. So I looked at some more of the details and found a couple interesting points.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/536c970837.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Garmin fƒìnix 5x</em></p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/0a42211841.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Apple Watch 6</em></p>
<p>You can see that both the Garmin and Apple Watch have the same start and stop times so I was correct at seeing the time clicking away when I had to re-enter my pin with 1 mile to go. However, that only goes to being more odd as the Apple Watch says the total time was 21:18 (head scratcher I know). Also, it says it didn‚Äôt have enough data for my Heart Rate. Something wasn‚Äôt working right the whole time because I would think even for a 2.5 mile run that would give it enough and I wear the watch pretty snug so it isn‚Äôt like it bounces around when I run. I guess Apple didn‚Äôt think I my <em>‚Äùeffort‚Äù</em> was enough to be recorded for at least the last 3.7 miles but really the whole thing for HR perspective.</p>
<p>Hopefully, I will get to finishing my post around the GPS accuracy at some point but it probably won‚Äôt be any silver bullet as shockingly there is a lot of information but maybe only a couple good explanations. Until then I will hold off my true thoughts on both I will keep wearing them üòÜ. ‚åöÔ∏è ‚åöÔ∏è</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I am not completely there yet but it seems a lot of my other projects as of lately have revolved around this idea of organizing things&hellip;</p>
<p>This probably started back in early January when I went down the rabbit hole of getting all my old DVDs on a computer to use with Plex as a way to free up some shelf space in the basement. I don‚Äôt remember the last time we have used any of those DVDs except a very small handful we take along in the RV. However, since putting them all on the computer, I think we have watched 10 movies off there so far. The next step in this process was getting a better handle on our Picture organization too, it aligned nicely with the first project because we had to get more HD space and in that purchase, we got a <em>new</em> computer so everything needed to be transferred from the old drive. With the new computer, the nice advantage is I have been able to remotely log into it and it is fast enough that I could look through old stuff and organize other things to fit with the process we use now. In fact, our picture process has even changed since I first had thought about it so maybe I will expand on that at another time.</p>
<p>Online organization, this I have written about before but I have really abandoned using my old blog / Instagram / Twitter and have doubled down on Mico.blog. I am happy with this change as I like everything in one place but I do find at times I might be over clutter the M.b timeline when I do some multiple posts from a weekend adventure. I like to toss a photo up to capture moments which is why a while back I mostly only used Instagram. I am still using it today but now I only use the app to follow some friends of mine that don‚Äôt really post anywhere else.</p>
<p>The next endeavor might take me a little longer to get done but I want to find the right tool or process to help me get more organized or stay organized. The issue is that I have realized a lack of organization in my life over the last year but probably has been a little longer than that. I hate to admit it, maybe it is an easy excuse but I think it has something to do with working from home and without having that separation and maybe a dedicated office space for non-work tasks, stuff has been blended together and I have not found a good way to reconcile all of it. There is also a lot of other things that have changed in my process over this time as well. I moved away from Evernote, which kept everything, to OneNote for some information and Day One for others. Additionally, once I completely ditched all my Android devices for iOS in 2021 (wow big purchase year), I then moved a little bit from OneNote into using more Apple Notes. So my storage of things is pretty fragmented right now as well and I think that is causing me panic as I don‚Äôt have a great system at this time.</p>

			 <p>I spent more time that I like to admit thinking about using a Read it Later service I ran across called <a href="https://www.wallabag.it/en">Wallabag</a> only to on a wim sign up for a trial subscription. However, I never got an email to log into it which was super frustrating and then I was about ready to just setup the service on my own server as that is an option. However, I wanted to trial their service and who know maybe I would have just paid for it as it wasn‚Äôt that expensive. Long story short, I realized not recieving the email was 100z5 my fault because when I moved a domain over to Porkbun I didn‚Äôt setup the email forwarding right ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. After getting that fixed, I decided to try to login to Wallabag again and see what this Read it Later service was all about.</p>
<p>Honestly, in the 2 min I used it and set up the Chrome Extension I had this feeling that I didn‚Äôt want it and probably would not use it anyways üòÅ. I think I realized again that anything I would stick in the <em>Read it Later</em> tool I would <strong>NEVER</strong> read later. It would just be a place of notes and I already have enough apps and tools that do that.</p>
<p>The closest I have come to using a Read It Later service on a more frequent basis was when I piped in RSS feeds directly to them and that was where I would just go read everything. My only issue with that was it wasn‚Äôt easy to just clear it out and declare RSS bankruptcy (which I do from time to time). Also, it came back to what would I do after I read an article do I archive it or delete it? I never went back and looked at prior saved articles and part of that is if I really wanted to remember something or retain something from what I read I would probably put it in a notes app.</p>
<p>So, after checking out another Read it Later service I am still back to not using a Read it Later service and I am ok with that. I did really like the name of the service though, in fact it could have been catchy&hellip; <strong>Wallabag.it</strong></p>

			 <p>This is something I should have done years ago honestly. However, as I have been moving more stuff to the old computer I used to use for some of my most recent <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2022/01/21/down-the-rabbit.html">projects</a>. I realized that it was very slowwwww&hellip; In fact, slow enough that now with the new to me Mac Mini up and running I can finally connect to it remotely and go through all my old files and not get frustrated and walk away. Finally it will be more than just a dumping ground that I never wanted to touch and might have some real <strong>order</strong>. To be clear, the old one did a great job of just backing up what was on it and the HD connected to it but other than that trying to log in and do something was a huge pain.</p>
<p>A couple weeks back I got this idea and saw a great deal for a used Mac Mini Late 2014 2.6GHz Dual Core i5. I decided to consulting with my new go to tech person, who gave it a thumbs up in agreement so I pulled the trigger. Not sure if he was just trying to get me to buy more Apple devices or if he really believed it was going to be better for meü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Either way, fast forward to earlier this week and it is fully setup and functioning. I am so happy with the setup and it takes up such a smaller footprint than the iMac 24-in early 2008, 2.8Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo üò±.</p>
<p>A big thanks again to <a href="https://burk.io">Jason Burk</a> for helping me figure out how to set all this stuff up in the best way possible. In fact right now I am connected to it on my iPad from my kids school analyzing some horrifying results of <a href="https://setapp.com/apps/gemini">Gemini</a> in the amount of duplicate photos I have <em>(note I am trying it out via Setapp)</em>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I am not sure how this happened but I have gone down what I will call the rabbit hole of projects lately by having too many and all of them are in flight right now. Each will be great when they are done and all serve different purposes. Here they are in somewhat a specific order of events:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Micro.blog</strong> - I got this idea finally to try making Micro.blog my home for all Posts, and Pictures. This involved rolling up my old Website and then importing my Instagram photos. Both of the projects are ‚ÄúDone‚Äù in theory. However, there is a lot more clean-up than I anticipated so this will be an ongoing project for a while. I thought I had the website import done and cleaned up but now that I am still working on the Instagram stuff I am finding more that did not come through due to the issues I outlined in that <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2022/01/05/all-in-on.html">post</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Plex.tv</strong> - I got this installed on an old Mac I have stashed away in the basement after hearing it come up from time to time in conversations from others. My first thought was to use it as an easier way to access Pictures and Videos I had stored on a central storage device in my house. We store all of our pictures and videos there (which is then backed up to Backblaze) but sometimes getting them back or finding them again is not as easy as it should be. File sharing is slow to display previews and standing in the laundry room to use the computer isn‚Äôt ideal either. So I have only added at this point the 2021 photo library we have as the scan on this old thing takes a while and I also need this computer to do other work <em>(see below)</em></li>
<li><strong>DVDs</strong> (Part 1) - I got this crazy idea to clean out this DVD shelf that has too many DVDs of which never get used but you can see it in the background of all my WebEx calls. I realized that I could just box them up and put them away but some of them I realized I don‚Äôt have digitally and now that my kids are getting older I might want to watch with them. Unfortunately, before I started to box any of these up my wife reminded me that we do use the DVDs sometimes when we go Camping since streaming is not an option. Sometimes it is nice to have some on hand as a backup when it rains. Hoping there was a way to figure this all out I was reminded of an article from fellow Micro.blog friend Jason Burk describing how he created the <a href="https://burk.io/2021/creating-the-golden-set">Golden Set</a> by converting his DVDs to MP4s. <strong>BINGO</strong> now I had a project. *Current status is after a couple trial and errors, I have done about 150 of our DVDs and I feel like I have a long way to go.</li>
<li><strong>DVDs</strong> (Part 2) - Due to some of the trial and errors of the first project I dug out an old computer I had gotten long ago. Come to find out it would be the perfect DVD machine but I realized that it did not have windows on it and that sent me down a path of digging through old CDs to find some sort of Windows CDs from past systems. I did find an old copy of Windows 8 which was working fine until I couldn‚Äôt seem to get any updates to fix the mouse drivers and whatnot. The solution was going to be to buy Windows 10 (which I wasn‚Äôt excited about) but I found out I was eligible for a free Windows 10 upgrade. That all worked well but it took some time to get to that point.</li>
<li><strong>Storage</strong> ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è&hellip; As you work through the above projects you can only guess this leads to the question of do you have enough storage for all of these DVDs that you are going to now make digital? The answer is NO.. No, I do not. However, this was going to be an issue before this project took off as a couple of months ago I realized my 4TB HD was getting within 100GB of reaching the end of its life. To me, that is too close. <em>I need to still figure this out in the meantime I had a 2TB removable drive that I am currently putting all the movies on after I pull them off the DVDs. However, I don‚Äôt want this to last too long as they are not getting backed up to Backblaze and that would be a pain to have to do it all over again.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Well hopefully some of these projects come to completion this week or throughout the next couple of weeks but I am sure they will drag on much longer than that.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Another step in migrating a lot of my stuff in one place has been completed. I wish I could say this was a super simple process that took an hour or less and was done. However, due to some <strong>user</strong> confusion, it took me more hours than I would like to add up. I was probably trying to do too many tasks at once but I ended up uploading a lot of duplicates which then required me to click into each Uploads page and Posts page and remove said duplicates ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Now in theory I would not have had to do this as it would only annoy anyone flipping through old posts but seeing how that for sure will be me it would annoy me and now seemed like the best time to clean it up before it really annoys me in the future <em>(future Eric better thank me)</em>.</p>
<p>Thinking back there are probably two things I should have done differently or paid closer attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Really understand what and how things were going to get pulled over to Micro.blog. I know it was said many times in what I had read on the post about it but I kind of forgot that I had a bunch of Instagram posts where I had 10 pictures in each. They were when we were traveling and I did a daily recap of our days. So&hellip; that then created 10 M.b posts that really require clean up as it also didn&rsquo;t pull over the caption for one or any of the 10 pictures.</li>
<li>Do smaller bathes of photos and remember to clear the selection after it is uploaded. I think this is where my duplicates came into place. I think I would start selecting the next batch before the first finished. So when I then clicked Import the next time some were duplicated.</li>
<li>Hashtags - Wow this seems like a fun idea when you are using Instagram but it is really a pain when you import all of them and you have a ton of hashtags for a photo. Now I should say, it looked fine but I just couldn‚Äôt live with myself having the hashtags that were of really no use to me in my new setup. This is one of those times I wish I could just do a find an replace. üòÜ</li>
<li>Emoji‚Äôs - Not sure why but theses didn‚Äôt really come though all the time. Some many times they were garbled. I guess it would have been good again to check this first but I think in my earlier or later times on Instagram I didn‚Äôt use them as much as I did at one time.</li>
</ul>
<p>I should say even though I had some frustration cleaning up the issues from the import. I don&rsquo;t really blame the program as it was really my own mistake in not fully paying attention or understanding.</p>
<p>One interesting thing I did find when going back though and cleaning up the pictures, there was a time that I posted some of the same things to my old blog as I did Instagram. As of now I kept them both there. I know I need to do some more cleanup so when that time comes I might remove some of them.</p>
<p><strong>Next up&hellip;</strong> I don‚Äôt know if there is much else left to bring into M.b. I have some other older sites that my wife and I used when we went to Peru and then when our son was born 6 weeks early. Those two were merged many years ago and then it was more or less a family site that we kept updating with pictures of the kids. However, each year that goes by we use it less and less and I am pretty sure we didn‚Äôt use it at all last year. If I decided to bring it in, I think it would only be parts and I would need to go back and make sure all is fixed before I do that as I don‚Äôt want to cause more problems for myself üòÜ.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I can‚Äôt say for sure this will be my final solution but it has made sense so far. A little while ago that I wanted to give this a try as I don‚Äôt like having too many different places on the internet to hold where my stuff is. I had been stuck for a while thinking of a new domain name and in the meantime I bought about 10 (yikes!). Maybe I will point some of them to some specific stuff on Micro.blog but my main one now for this domain is going to just be <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog">EricMWalk.blog</a>. I think I will make a simple static site that my EricMWalk.com can be pointed to and there I can point people to other projects I have worked on. However, right now it just goes to my old WordPress blog so still need to get that changed.</p>
<p>So I finally did it and moved all of my old posts from my self hosted WordPress blog to Micro.blog so I would have finally one source of information <em>(well not exactly more on that later)</em>. Overall the import process in Micro.blog worked flawlessly except, I did find some issues but they were self inflicted for many reasons. The one I assumed I would run into was any links I had in my posts to other posts on my site which would not get updated correctly. I was right on that but luckily I didn‚Äôt have too many posts with that issue and I could correct that problem somewhat quickly by doing a search in the Micro.blog post section for my old site name. However, the two bigger unknowns to me that I probably should have expected but didn‚Äôt think about were having too many tags and that pictures didn‚Äôt import.</p>
<p>Tags - This was nightmare. I guess though the years on WordPress I got very Tag happy as it didn‚Äôt seem hard to just add them as you went and honestly I probably didn‚Äôt use them too much but to find related things or maybe others did. However, all of them got imported into Micro.blog and I quickly realized that my one off tags were very messy. So I went though and painfully deleted as many as I could. I still have more than I like but it was a good start to see how I can use tags going forward. I think the interesting thing for tags in Micro.blog is that they are their own feeds so I might do something with that at some point.</p>
<p>Pictures <em>(Root Cause - Old Domain Names ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)</em> - This is a problem of having various domain names over the years. Micro.blog did an exactly what it was suppose to do and did an excellent job importing the photos to Micro.blog when it could ‚Äúfind‚Äù the photos. However, since some of the domains I don‚Äôt have anymore I had broken links on my WordPress site that I had not really realized so Micro.blog couldn‚Äôt find the photo to import. I am not sure if there is a quicker way to fix it on the Micro.blog side of things but honestly if I would have maybe thought about this before I exported everything I more than likely could have cleaned it up to make it work more seamlessly.</p>
<p>Other than those two minor hiccups I am glad to have gone full in on Micro.blog and with that I am hoping to be posting more photos, thoughts, and other things I find interesting all in one spot.</p>
<h4 id="next-up">Next up&hellip;</h4>
<p>Since I have not been using Facebook (forever really), and Instagram has been less and less. I stoped really posting to Facebook specifically a long time ago and just did instagram and my WordPress blog but since the beginning of 2021 I have been really using Micro.blog to post the quick photos I would have done there. So next up I am thinking of pulling all of my historic Instagram posts to Micro.blog after I ran across this <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/import-from-instagram/77">help post</a>.</p>

		<a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/21/xx-recap.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-12-21 15:12:38 -0400">Dec 21, 2021</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Two weeks ago I decided to set off on completing a <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/01/xx-running-challenge.html">4x4x40</a> as part of some crazy ideas for my 40th birthday year. However, after I reached the 40 miles I felt like I really needed to continue as I figured at that point I might never do this again and get so close to hitting the real number and completing a 4x4x48 (run 4 miles every 4 hours for 48 hours). Maybe it helped that I was a bit sleep deprived at the time and not thinking clearly as I figured what was two more 4 mile runs at that point.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/d0d7eda4b0.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Since I posted after each of my runs with a short photo, time, and thought I will not rehash all of them. I don‚Äôt want to make light of this challenge as I think it was hard but the miles themselves weren‚Äôt the worst for me. Some of that could have been that I didn‚Äôt really have a pace per mile in mind. I obviously wasn‚Äôt going to try to run the fastest 4 miles I could every time. However, in my mind, I wanted to keep all of my averages per run under 9 min/miles. The biggest struggle for me during this challenge was trying to fit it in during a normal working day. Due to the weather forecast and maybe my last-minute planning, as it was December, I did it during the middle of a workweek. So I scheduled it out earlier in the week and pretty much created an appointment for myself every 4 hrs. It worked great the first day but the second day some things came up at work so I had to shrink down one of my 3 hr blocks of <em>recovery</em> and extend other ones. I still was able to get the run in that 4 hr bock but I wasn‚Äôt as consistently on the hour as I was the first day of running. In a way, I am wondering if working both days helped me keep my focus away from running and how tired I might have been as I was doing things I needed to do during the day. Then in the evenings I still helped get the kids to activities and stuff.</p>
<p>Now obviously the lack of sleep is one thing but the worst time of runs for me was the 5am runs that I did. I think it is because after the late-night 1am run it always took me longer than anticipated to fall asleep. You would have thought I would have been tired enough to just get into the house and fall asleep. I am guessing that the kick of adrenaline that was in my body messed with allowing my brain to shut down at that time. So for both days by the time I would will myself to sleep and it would work I think I only got 1 hr before I would have to wake up at 5am to run. After that run, I would just start my day and didn‚Äôt try to get any more rest as my youngest gets on the bus at 7am.</p>
<p>In the end, I have never run so many miles in two days. It ended up being 48.9 miles due to one run when I put my trust in a running friend who lead me astray by an extra mile. Those two days were more mileage than I had completed any week during my marathon training this past year. It was an interesting challenge as it took careful planning as I still worked and helped with kid activities like a normal day. It was just I ran every 4 hrs üòÅ. The day after I was done I felt pretty wiped out from most likely lack of sleep and over-exercise. Fast forward two weeks later and I am back on track. Maybe I will do another one of these challenges someday but probably no time soon. At least for the rest of this year, it will be back to the normal scheduled running for me.<br>

			 <p>Earlier this year I had a plan to run 40 miles with a really good friend of mine through the mountains of Colorado. We thought it would be fun to run 40 miles since we both turned 40 this year. Not to mention suffering together and probably laughing along the way made it seem like a feat that could be pushed through to accomplishment. The timing was not going to be great for me as it was one month before my <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/10/04/twin-cities-marathon.html">Twin Cities Marathon</a> but I was game to do it as it sounded amazing. Honestly, I wasn‚Äôt even sure how to train for such a thing but I just said yes and he said he would work out the details. The bummer is around May he hurt his ankle and knew the run wouldn‚Äôt happen. I was bummed that it fell apart but it probably worked out since I hadn‚Äôt run a marathon for 20 years and I wasn‚Äôt sure what I was in for. I am sure it probably wouldn‚Äôt have been great to come in not feeling the best from a 40 mile run through the mountains no matter how long it took us.</p>
<p>Fast forward to about 1 month before I ran the marathon and I stumbled across this concept of running 4 miles every 4 hours for 48 hours. At the time I didn‚Äôt know anything about it but thought that had a nice ring to it. However, the whole 48 hrs didn‚Äôt mesh with my goal so I figured I would modify it slightly to fit as a <strong><em>4x4x40</em></strong> instead üòÅ.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4 miles every 4 hours for 40 hours since I am 40 this year</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That leads me up to now&hellip; After the <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/10/04/twin-cities-marathon.html">marathon</a>, I have been trying to take it easy and just running for pleasure but I feel like I have been missing something as I had hoped to do something else with this <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/03/24/forty.html">year 40</a>. After pondering this for the last month, I realized that if I am going to do it I need to do it before it gets too cold in the night to complete this task so I am going to start tonight (or today) and we will see how this goes.</p>
<p>I do know more about the real 4x4x48 challenge and the guy who created it. However, my goal still has not changed. I will probably write about it as I go mostly just to document it along the way so I apologize to anyone not interested in this disregard my posts for at least more than 40 hrs from the first. Then we will be back to our regularly scheduled posting.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt have any main goals in mind if you are wondering. My goal is probably to do as many of these 4x4s that I can in hopes to get to 40 but that is a lot of mileage for me in a short amount of time. Also, I am not concerned about my pace either except hoping I don‚Äôt go too fast at any point as that could screw things up. Either way, this is going to be an interesting experiment no matter how many I get done so we will see how it goes!</p>
<p>A final note for those interested, I am still working and getting kids to school and activities. So I am kind of treating this as just some breaks throughout my day and that is another reason why this time lined up perfectly. In the perfect world, I would only be doing this 40hrs with no other responsibilities. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

			 <p>Brecken has been begging us to go family bowling since he has started in this junior League every that plays every Saturday. With his new ball finally ready it seemed like the right time for a Sunday morning family fun. Can‚Äôt beat the prices at Tuttles for $2.50 per game so we got there early and had a late breakfast while we bowled for a couple hours. Everyone seemed to enjoy doing something different but I think the third game might have been a little too much. With our family of 5 it took us about 1 hr to bowl a game but everyone powered through even with some touch and go moments at some times üòÅ.</p>

			 <p>Prompted from an episode of <a href="https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/041">Hemispheric Views</a> where they brought up this subject of Nostalgic November where you would share a memory of anything from your past that brings a smile to your face. I hadn‚Äôt thought much of it since I listened to the episode but all of a sudden over the last couple of days I realized things I was doing, researching, or even talking about have been reminding me of something from my youth.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/11aab6df29.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="trains-"><strong>Trains&hellip; üöÇ</strong></h2>
<p>That is right, trains. I have always had this interest / fascination with trains which at some point also lead me to model trains when I was younger. I am not sure when it ever first started but it could have been a visit to the Henry Ford Museum as a kid, or watching trains go by the train tracks at the end of the street, or maybe from my walks home from school or when my friend and I would go exploring train bridges and walk along the tracks near our houses, or it could just be they are huge machines and as a kid that is really cool! I am not sure when my interest in trains finally led me to model trains but when that happened I remember being interested all over again as it was something I could purchase, build, and tinker with all the extra electronics.</p>
<p>Over the years, I stopped getting more model train stuff and boxed everything up when I went to college. After college, there was a brief time when I lived with my brother and I got really into it again and started buying engines and other parts as a local store was going out of business. However, once I moved away to Chicago that obsession stopped again. Once I moved back to Minnesota and we had younger kids I set up the track and got all the trains out a couple of times but even then that has now passed. They are now sitting in a box high up in the closet of our basement craft room. Maybe someday I will bring them down and set them up again.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/432e6aabab.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>One thing is for sure, anytime I find myself running on an old Rail Trail, crossing train tracks to get somewhere, visiting places with old train Depots, or even thinking about how I used to walk home from school. All of those experiences trigger memories of when I was younger.</p>

			 <p>Decided to follow a trail with 6 tunnels yesterday along the 3.4 mile <a href="https://onthegomap.com/s/t0pshhke">Bluff Creek Local Trail</a> in Chanhassen üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

<p>W 78th St Tunnel <em>(the start of the trail)</em></p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/205384dc28.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Arboretum Blvd Tunnel <em>(It is really two tunnels as you can see the space in the center but really only one road so I am counting it as one)</em></p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/75ebf43d4e.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Coulter Blvd Tunnel</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/9b2552b300.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Twin Cities &amp; Western Railroad Tunnel</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/ba7e22bc52.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Lyman Blvd Tunnel</p>

<p>Bluff Creek Road Tunnel</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/06cf92e00a.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Then I actually found the end of the trail so I turned around and ran back to my car üòÅ. I had actually never run on this trail before so even though the map said it was going to end sometimes things aren‚Äôt updated that well and I was thinking it might have gone further. So it did surprise me when I came to the end and the path did not go further or connect up to anything else. I am guessing it is because if they wanted to keep extending it South they would have to figure out how to go over or under HWY-212.</p>
<p>Overall, it was really nice trail that was all asphalt so I might have to remember this one for next summer with the kids as the distance isn‚Äôt to crazy either.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong>: Since I didn‚Äôt post this yesterday as planned, I dug into some of the old Chanhassen park records and it seems like the Master Park / Trail plans from 2017 and 2018 assumed they would continue it further South. I wonder if once the construction of HWY-212 was completed they just abandoned the original plan or maybe didn‚Äôt leave a passage to get under it. I did notice that the HWY was on the original plans but based on what I know it wouldn‚Äôt have been completed at that time and was still a work in progress. Additionally, the details of their plan never really addressed how it was going to get past that HWY like other referenced markings on the plan to show an existing bridge or tunnel.</em></p>

			 <p>Back when I was a long time Fitbit user, I used to have a scale from them as well so all of my fitness information was in once place. In fact, from time to time I would keep track of foods I ate in the Fitbit app as well and it worked pretty well overall.</p>
<p>However, as time has passed I got <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/10/08/goodbye-fitbit.html">frustrated with Fitbit</a> and it‚Äôs lack of durability from my point of view and move to a Garmin. I still used my Fitbit scale until it broke not long after but also my wife had bought one of those <a href="myshapa.com">Shapa scales</a> that was about the worst type of scale out there. Sorry, I am sure it works for some people but for me I could care less what color I had I just wanted to know my actual weight in lbs üòÜ. I did figure out how I could get a number by having the information shared with Google Fit and then I could just manually put it into my Garmin Connect app. I hate to say I did that for longer than I would like to have admitted before I got tired of doing the manual part and just donated the scale as no one else was using the piece of garbage anyways.</p>
<p>That brings me to today as I would like to keep track of my weight again as well as try to track my calorie intake. I am trying to figure out the best route to take here and am open to suggestions. Ideally, I would like a single app that could pull all of this information together as a one stop shop. I know I could buy a normal scale and enter the information manually but for me I want to set a routine of standing on the scale and not make notes to myself to record it in a system. I just want it to be automatic! Kind of like the Fitbit did for me before but since I don‚Äôt have a Fitbit watch that seems kind of silly for that and I have found nothing plays super nice with Garmin Connect. Ideally, it would be something that can send data to or pull information from Garmin Connect or Apple Health.</p>
<p><em>Any suggestions send them my way please!</em></p>

			 <p>I really can‚Äôt believe that I found my Apple Pencil late yesterday. As I kept thinking about it I was trying to remember what was around me at the table where I was working the day before. The problem is everything had gotten moved around as well as the kids dumped all of their Halloween candy out to sort through so I had to think about what was there the day before. I looked all over the floor and around the area thinking maybe it rolled off or got attached to the metal under the table or on the chairs. Also, we have a new coffee bar that has metal doors on it so I thought maybe it attached itself to that. Finally, while looking at that I saw the new black metal baskets my wife bought for us and I remembered how my daughter got some white ones as well. So I walked back to her room and sure enough as you can see it attached itself to the metal white basket that she showed me before she moved it back to her room. I am still surprised that I found it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>It has been so long since I have actually logged into and looked around at my WordPress powered <a href="https://upnorth.blog">UpNorth.blog</a> site that I realized so much stuff is outdated.</p>
<p>Right now I push all the content from Micro.blog there as it was how I set it up a year ago and I actually don‚Äôt mind the process flow. Nothing that gets pushed over there is published to the front page unless I want it to be and have to log in to make it happen. Otherwise all of these posts are kind of hidden in the background. I know if you really wanted to find it you could but you might have to dig a little or know what to search for. There has only been a couple times in the past year that I have taken a post I published on Micro.blog and made sure it hit the main page of that site.</p>
<p>As I keep looking at the couple of site pages I have, I found my about page hadn‚Äôt been updated for 4 years as it talked about some work I did with a different non-profit. Also, I realized I had a newsletter subscribe and archive link there that I haven‚Äôt even sent anything out since 3 years ago as well.</p>
<p>I guess I am trying to figure out the purpose of this site as anything I want to share or post I publish to my Micro.blog site. I don‚Äôt really need a professional site of any kind so it is almost a backup of my Micro.blog which isn‚Äôt the end of the world but I have been thinking about changing things up again.</p>

			 <p>I believe today marks my one year of using Micro blog or at least based on my post from a year ago <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2020/10/13/new-day-new.html">today</a> (my one year being a paid member is coming up). However, with that said I now see my <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/on-this-day/">On this Day</a> page doesn‚Äôt work üòí (add that to my list to look into another time).</p>
<p>Thinking back, I can‚Äôt believe it took me so long to find this platform or maybe I saw it and didn‚Äôt think to use it.</p>
<p>Either way I have enjoyed the past year learning about what is possible and in some places figuring out a work around or how it can work for me. Honestly, the best part of Micro.blog is the community and acquaintances that I have made through this platform. It kind of fits with what I have always looked for when blogging. I do it mostly for myself but if someone else reads it and finds it interesting then great. Also, since it is ingrained into everything else on Micro.Blog then I can find others that are like minded and interested in similar topics.</p>
<p>Even after a year of using Micro.blog I am still not entirely sure what my setup is going to look like but for now it is working and the linking I have done between my older <a href="https://upnorth.blog">WordPress</a> blog works.</p>

			 <p>Well after all the build up for the past 9 months the race is done and I am happy with my own results. After, what has been a 20 year hiatus <em>(more on that below)</em> I was glad to conquer this one in much more style, less pain, and a time I had not planned for üòÅ. As I have told most people who ask me, it is amazing what some real training does when preparing for a marathon.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/3380c7fa50.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Building up to race day I was asked what time or pace I was shooting for and in reality I didn‚Äôt have much thought. Well there was some thoughts but honestly my goal was faster than 20 years ago time but more specifically I was shooting for under 4 hrs since I felt even being 20 years older I could bet that time of <a href="https://www.mtecresults.com/runner/show?rid=3083&amp;race=3588">4:15:17</a> by 15 min. Not only did I beat that time I crushed it by 35 minutes for a time of <strong><a href="https://www.mtecresults.com/runner/show?rid=2402&amp;race=12105">3:39:28</a></strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/924e8a2dbb.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Also, I can‚Äôt thank my family enough for coming out to support me as it was great seeing people I knew from time to time throughout the day.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/b80a8a665b.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Not to mention my champion wife who was trucking around the Twin Cities to various points even though she didn‚Äôt know the roads very well while with her was 3 kids of which some expired at my 2 hr mark.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/e95deeb0dc.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>She was there for the first one 20 years ago so it was great to have her and the rest of my cheering section. Also, for the last push of 6 miles I saw my uncle on the sidelines saying ‚Äúlooks like you got this one‚Äù which was a great confidence booster in the middle of the 3 mile uphill climb.</p>

##2001 Race Background##
20 years ago on a whim I signed up for the 2001 Twin Cities Marathon sometime after I had just turned 20. I am not really sure what I was thinking but I believe in a way it was because I had not keep up running much from my High School days and missed it. I also thought I would share in the punishment and poor college student me signed my brother up (who was working at the time) as well since he lived in Minneapolis. I figured what was he going to do if I signed him up for it, not show up?</p>
<p>I jumped right into some training plan I am sure I found on the internet at the time and was following it religiously throughout that summer as I stayed up at school and all my friends went home. However, when the training plan started to tick up miles school was back in session and my training fell off the radar. I don‚Äôt even think I ran anything of value or consistency the month before the race. Talk about coming in cold. In fact, the longest I had run before that 2001 Marathon was 13 miles.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs just say the day turned out as you would have expected, the adrenaline and excitement pushed me though probably 17 miles worth. Then I gritted it out for another 3 that I can‚Äôt remember. The last 6.2 miles were torchure and I think most of it has escaped me. From what I remember it was a lot of walking for that last 6.2 miles and seems right as up to that point I was tracking time well and then it took me one and fifteen minutes to complete that last 6.2 miles. I remember finally realizing that I as only 1 mile from the finish and I think that is when I started to somewhat run again knowing the end was finally in sight. The best part of that race was that I crossed the finish line with my uncle and to this day we all still joke how I touched the finish line first.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/2a678fda02.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>However, in reality when I was dying on those last miles at some point he passed me up and I caught back up to him in the final stretch. Since that time but probably not right after I kept telling myself that if I was ever going to run another one and I did want to I wanted to make sure I trained for it much better than before. Don‚Äôt get me wrong it wasn‚Äôt that the time was overly horrible but I knew I could have done better so it was my goal.</p>

			 <p>Earlier this week where I live a runner, <a href="https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-news/eden-prairie-man-found-dead-was-training-for-the-chicago-marathon">Mike Elhard</a>, who was going out on a 20 mile training run for the Chicago Marathon went missing on Monday morning. He wasn‚Äôt running at night or even during really hot weather as it was 10am and the day was actually cooler than normal. Once they realized he was missing the local police and residences searched that late afternoon and into the evening on roads and paths near his house and routes he frequently took. Unfortunately, he was found dead Tuesday just off a sidewalk in some brush. The police said there was no signs of foul play but nothing else has been released.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/c33ec0c365.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>As I was running yesterday, I couldn‚Äôt shake the thought out of my mind as I too am a runner mostly running by myself during the week. I am fortunate enough that my longer runs I have been running with a friend in the area.</p>
<p>Even though I never knew Mike, I want to think we might have crossed paths at some point along the trails and probably gave a nod, or wave or maybe just smiled at each other.</p>
<p>Mike was only 39 and probably in pretty good shape seeing how he was going to run a Marathon in a couple weeks as well and was out on his 20 mile long run. I am only 40 and it really puts things in perspective how short life can be sometimes. Rest In Peace fellow runner.</p>

			 <p>Honestly, I am not very good at keeping in touch with people. This could really be anyone, friends, old co-workers, newer acquaintances. For some reason, I always have great intentions of reaching out but just never feel it is the right time to reach out and say I will later.</p>
<p>I was reminded of this the other day while running and I passed an old co-worker and friend of mine walking with his wife. I said hi quick but since I was running with another guy I didn&rsquo;t stop to talk. After I got done I was reminded that I have been meaning to reach out to this guy for a long time and every time I would think about it I would find about 100x other things to accomplish. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong it has nothing to do with the other guy because I do this all of the time. It is just one of those tasks that always get buried for me thinking I will find a better time to reach out or I will do it right after work.</p>
<p>I guess you could say it is a good thing I am aware of it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. However, I am going to try to be better and see about setting time aside for starters each week to reconnect with some people whom I haven&rsquo;t but have been meaning to for a while. We all get busy from time to time and with kids thrown into the mix it gets even worse. However, there is always time to keep connections flowing instead of dead ends.</p>

			 <p>I had been an Android user for as long as I can remember and have always enjoyed the phones and software. Maybe I should caveat that last statement with I have had a bunch of iPhones too but at one point I was drawn more to Android and then I really had not looked back and honestly kind of refused to for no real reason. However, after being nagged by my family I broke down in May of this year to get the iPhone mini.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/48b69212e0.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>My original goal was to use the iPhone mini as my main phone for texts (iMessages specifically) but continue to keep my Galaxy S-21 as it took amazing photos and videos. I figured I would run with the Galaxy and use it when we went on family trips. However, I quickly remembered I did not like the two phone life after 2 weeks and ended up selling the Galaxy S-21 as it was still pretty new and there was some value I could get out of selling it. I think one of the big things for me that made this switch easy was the size of the iPhone mini, even though my Galaxy was not large the iPhone mini was the perfect size as I didn‚Äôt need a huge screen that was not the purpose of the phone for me.</p>
<p>After a month of using the iPhone mini with my Galaxy Tab S7 (with a keyboard of course), I started to get the itch of having the devices sync together better so that got me looking at the iPads. The original reason I got the Galaxy Tab was to use it as a replacement for paper to take handwritten notes at work. I could link up to my companies Office 365 and use OneNote which wasn‚Äôt all that bad and I liked having the notes on my tablet and computer synced (my work only had and still has Windows computers). The other reason I got the Galaxy Tab was to be able to have a more personal device when traveling for work and pre-pandemic I traveled quite a bit so it was nice to have a device of my own to do things on that wasn‚Äôt my work computer. So fast forward to the end of July it kind of seemed like a no-brainer to get an iPad as it could do what my Android tablet could do and it would sync better with my phone. So I broke down and bought an iPad Pro 11‚Äù with Magic Keyboard for iPad and the Apple Pencil 2.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/4f97487afa.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Now if only I could use a Mac for work instead of this clunky Dell Windows machine I would be happier but it is ok. With the iPad Pro 11‚Äù, since I got the keyboard, I mostly just carry that around to use when I am not working on work stuff in the house. I will give Apple a lot of credit here on the keyboard as they really did it right with how the keyboard works as it can be propped up by itself without needing to be set on a desk.</p>
<p>I feel like now with my new devices I need to go back and listen to all the Podcasts that I have in the past 4 years that talk about iOS apps as I always listened to them but a lot of the time since there was not an Android version I just forgot about them.</p>
<p><em>Next up finding new apps üòÅ..</em></p>

			 <p>Sometimes you have to <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/02/09/back-to-running.html">start over</a> at ground zero. Well technically I am probably not at ground zero this time because I only had four days off in a row.</p>
<p>This week however I have been getting back into running or restart my running has been a struggle. I have found it much more difficult that I would have thought based on the amount of mileage I typically run and how often I had been running each week. However, I am still probably not 100% better from my Achilles heel pain (or this is what my PT friends tell me I have). In addition, the heat and humidity earlier this week has not helped in my attempts to ease back into running. I restarted this week doing shorter than normal runs but since my only time was late afternoon I was battling getting back at it during the hottest times of day.</p>
<p>I have <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/07/08/it-is-official.html"><strong>45 days</strong></a> left until the Twin Cities Marathon &hellip; Right now my goal is to not get injured more and get my comfort level back up when running longer miles.</p>
<p><strong>Let‚Äôs get this!</strong></p>

			<h1><a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/07/08/i-hte-running.html">üìö I HüíõTE RUNNING AND YOU CAN TOO by Brendan Leonard</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/07/08/i-hte-running.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-07-08 09:32:00 -0400">Jul 8, 2021</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>If you are looking for a great motivational book to keep you going in whatever you are trying to do look no further. If you are looking for a book about how to run then this might not be what you are looking for but you should pick this one up as well to give you some laughs along your running journey.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The great part about this book is that it is all about the Running journey and exploring why people run and the motivation behind it. By using Brendan&rsquo;s and others' relatable running stories it frames up challenges all of us face to just get motivated to do things in life. There are always obstacles in the way, better things to do, or thinking we are too busy to do something. As a &ldquo;runner&rdquo; myself, I can personally relate to the specific stories of running as no matter how much I love running, being outdoors, It is much better to have the run done and behind me as I too am someone that struggles most of the time to just get out the door.  Specific to running, everyone has their own story and reasons why they run and Brendan also explores that as part of the book.</p>
<p><a href="https://semi-rad.com/2021/03/people-who-get-to-decide-what-the-point-of-all-your-running-is/"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Now I am a fan of Brendan Leonard fan of his work from his site <a href="https://semi-rad.com">Semi-Rad</a>, and this book did not disappoint. That being said, I have seen some of these graphs before but the rest of the story and context is short, witty, and perfectly sized for most of us to get through in a timely manor.</p>
<p>One of my favorite parts of the book is when he is talking about what he calls the &ldquo;invisible work&rdquo; which in the context of the book is all of the miles and hours you put in before a race or event. In fact, for someone like myself who is planning on running a <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/07/08/it-is-official.html">Marathon</a> later this year, I have already run about 37 marathons with the number of miles I have put in so far.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Inspiration is for amateurs. The rest of us just show up and get to work. - Chuck Close</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall, I couldn&rsquo;t recommend this book more but honestly don&rsquo;t just take my word for it and pick up a <a href="https://semi-rad.com/books/">copy from the links on his website</a>. The best thing is it is a smaller-sized book so you can carry it with you on all of your adventures (well maybe not while running) so you can refer to the helpful motivational kick in the butt that is needed from time to time while doing anything. Honestly, I wish I had this book a couple of years back when I was content with just running a <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/09/30/k-a-day.html">5k a day</a> as some days were harder to get motivated than others. As I am now running longer miles with slightly less frequency, I feel like this book helps keep me motivated to get out there.</p>

			 <p>Pretty sure I was chased by the same bird that followed me a couple of weeks <a href="https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/06/18/i-was-followed.html">back</a>. This time however it was less in a fun way of circling me and more of an attacking / intimidating me. I am guessing the bird has a nest that is close to this boardwalk path since it seemed quite upset with me after I ran by a specific bush that is really close to the path. I remember seeing it flying by me and then instantly circled and flew after me chirping along the way. I looked back probably 3 different times and it was no more than 5 feet from me in the air acting like it would like to peck me in the head. After I finally got away and realized it wasn&rsquo;t following me I snapped this picture.</p>

			 <p>This little issue sucked away a good chunk of time for me yesterday when all of a sudden the lights where I work shut off. Problem was some power was still flowing through to the tracks and even to the light fixtures but when I put a bulb in the fixtures nothing and the. I realized power would drop on other open light fixtures. That is when what I was hoping was a quick fix turned into a longer project as I had to take the whole track lighting down to get to the main wiring. That is when I found this gem ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

<p>Yep, older wiring in houses are an adventure indeed.</p>
<p>Luckily, I have tackled something like this before as I have replaced out fixtures and outlets so I had all the supplies I needed to hopefully not have it happen again. All fixed now and track lighting is working perfectly again. üí°üë®‚Äçüîß</p>

It doesn&rsquo;t take me long to take a quick picture and put my phone away but to my surprise as i kept running there were some deer watching me. In fact, looking back at my photo now I can spot one but I didnt see it tell after I started up again.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><em><strong>Forty</strong></em>‚Ä¶ Yep, you read that right I hit the big <strong>4-0</strong> this year which besides the number I don‚Äôt feel much different today.</p>
<p>Looking back over the past year all I can say it has been a strange one indeed. I have always wanted the chance to work from home and boy did I get it. In the past year, I have only gone to the office three times and taken one business trip (which was just a month ago to the middle of nowhere Indiana).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However, some good things came out of last year as the whole family spent a lot more time together than typically. We purchased a Camper in July of last year and after getting it we found a way to use that thing almost every weekend until we put it in storage for the winter. We had been thinking of buying a camper for a while so once we saw that we probably wouldn‚Äôt be traveling like our normal road trips that we had been thinking about it seemed like no better time than to pull the trigger on the RV. I won‚Äôt say every trip was magical with the family but overall everyone enjoyed it and enjoyed exploring the various State Parks in our area. It was a good way for us to get away from our house and all the electronics that are inside of it. However, April and I did work on some of our camping adventures. We figured since we were both working remotely and if we didn‚Äôt mind having to be creative to connect to the internet it would be great to squeeze a couple more days on the front and back end of weekend trips.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Working from home has been interesting (ok bad sometimes) but in other ways good. It is hard to really slice and dice my complete thoughts on this but I think simply put I enjoy being able to get my kids on and off the bus each day. I appreciate this school year as opposed to last where they were learning from home full time as I am not a great teacher myself and those days it was harder to focus on my work. However, being honest my wife took the brunt of the teaching and keeping the kids on task and I am forever grateful for her always keeping the family in order. The hardest thing for kids I think to understand when they would have days off and mom and dad are working from home is they are not sure why we won‚Äôt play with them NOW. As smart as all my kids are, they are still shocked when they have a no school day and I still have to work. I think the kids believe that we should all be on the same schedule.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One of the benefits I have really been reaping this year working from home is Running. I used to be a morning runner by default because I wanted to get it done before I went to work each day. I knew myself and if I didn‚Äôt do it then, then I might not do it at all. This past year things have changed, I not only didn‚Äôt want to wake anyone up in the morning but I also realized that I could avoid running in the dark often as I could duck out for an hour during the middle of the day.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Embracing was the theme of last year and I feel like that was accomplished with how our family got to spend more time together doing different things and how more recently I have doubled down in focusing on my running personally. I came in strong last year thinking about running a Marathon but then when the pandemic hit and everything got canceled it only took me a month later to start lagging in my motivation to keep running a bunch of miles. However, I did get a spark of new hope after we got the camper again as we were visiting all of these cool State Parks that had miles of trails. So I made sure that every park I tried to explore as much as I could by either hiking with the family or just going out for a run at some point during our stay.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes a change of scenery is a great motivation to get out there and explore (or run).</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Since the start of January, I have decided to take a different approach to my running by really trying to get more longer runs weekly. Previously, I would have probably only run one or two 6.2 mile runs a week and that was about all I could handle with other 3.1 mile runs sprinkled in. Right now I have a goal of running the Twin Cities Marathon later this year as it has been exactly 20 years since I have run a marathon (that one in fact). I have something else up my sleeve as well but still working on the execution to make sure it goes through. If so it will be fun for sure and make that Marathon extra hard with the little rest between the events. I have been pleased with my efforts so far but the road is still long ahead. If anything, I have continued to build on longer runs throughout the week, and as a benefit, I have been able to explore a lot of new places around my house by going outside what was a 3.1 mile radius.</p>
<p>As things are ever-changing in the world today with the virus and vaccine rollout, I am optimistic to see what this next year will be as I am rolling into another decade. As I still am thinking Embracing seems like another fitting theme, I will expand that as I would like to continue <strong>‚ÄúLearning‚Äù</strong>. More on that topic but this is long enough and the kids are about ready to get off the bus ‚ò∫.</p>

			 <p>Last night I was looking for a place I ran in Germany when I was there on a work trip in 2015. I then realized when I stopped using my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fitbit in 2019<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I didn&rsquo;t import that far back to my Garmin as I wasn&rsquo;t using Strava then either.</p>
<p>As I logged back into Fitbit for the first time in a long time I was hit in the face again with how terrible their activity log and reporting is. Not to mention if you want your GPS data back and not a crummy CVS output of steps good luck!</p>
<p>Unforentually, my realization that I did not import my data from 2014-2016 into Strava or Garmin sent me down a rabbit hole of manual tasks by finding all my old runs in Fitbit to download. I am happy to say that task is done and I can thankfully (hopefully) never log into Fitbit again üòÅ.</p>

			 <p>It has been <!-- raw HTML omitted -->5 years since<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the Blogging Meetup was started as it came about from a group of us that wanted to keep the conversation going after a Blogging Bootcamp that was put on by WordPress.com. Honestly, in thinking back I can not believe it has been 5 years but also, I know in the past 1.5 years the site has kind of remained the same and there hasn&rsquo;t been the engagement as there was in the first couple of years.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Long story short it is time to say <strong>goodbye</strong>‚Ä¶ As of <em><strong>March 1,</strong></em> 2021, it will just remain an archive of information with nothing new posted.</p>
<p>I should probably address some simple questions that you may or may not be asking at this point‚Ä¶<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h5 id="why"><strong>Why?</strong></h5>
<p>Mostly because I feel like it is time and I think in looking at the stats the Community believes it is time as well. I think most people who have joined over the years found that the WordPress Reader does a great job of keeping you up to date on current posts and makes it simple to quickly interact with one another. Not to mention there are Twitter and Facebook that allow people to easily ask questions and interact/follow others with similar interests.</p>
<p>That is not to say I don&rsquo;t think a Community like this couldn&rsquo;t work or isn&rsquo;t valuable. I just think this specific community has run its course and it is time to close down.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h5 id="will-this-be-temporary-with-a-comeback-at-a-later-date"><strong>Will this be temporary with a comeback at a later date?</strong></h5>
<p>No, this is not just temporary. The plan is permanent but I will never say never. If something would ever take the place with the same name it would have to take on a different form altogether in my opinion but at this point, I have no plans to have a comeback tour.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h5 id="wont-you-miss-this"><strong>Won&rsquo;t you miss this?</strong></h5>
<p>Of course, I will miss this, even though I haven&rsquo;t used it much in the last year I believe the site provided a lot of great value over the years. Also, it is something that was created, time was spent dreaming up ideas and executing various actions to make it what it was. It was a passion project and I honestly enjoyed every minute I worked on it even when I was looming over my head to get another task or post published.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h3 id="closing"><strong>Closing</strong></h3>
<p>I could go on and on but in closing, I will miss the community we had as this was such a fun project over the past 5 years, and even though I am the one saying Goodbye I will still miss it. Thanks to EVERYONE who helped pioneer and champion, or those who joined, contributed, and followed along in the past. I wish each and every one of you more success in your blogging careers!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Veil<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Eliot Peper (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->@EliotPeper<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) was just released a week ago and I really can‚Äôt say enough good things about it. If you are looking for a great book then look no further as Eliot has produced another great page-turner after not long ago finishing his most recent sequels.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<em>The book was released on May 20th, 2020, but I was lucky enough to get an advanced copy from my good friend Eliot himself. However, I enjoyed the book so much that once it was released I purchased another copy as well for my collection.</em><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Unlike some of Eliot‚Äôs other books, I actually felt like this one started a little slower but that was a good thing. As with a lot of good books, it built you up getting to know the characters and backgrounds. Speaking of, the main character, Zia Le√≥n seems like your normal humanitarian that leads various aid missions to help areas in need. However, what makes Zia unique is she comes with sass and attitude that fits her well in order to get the job done.</p>
<p>As the first part of the story goes I was trying at times to see how all the pieces were going to fit together. Honestly, it took me a little while to start putting the pieces together, and then all of a sudden a kidnapping happened and I could not put this book down. Not only does the story speed up but more is revealed along the way that made it even more of a page-turner. I soon found out that the adventure was just beginning for Zia.</p>
<p>Eliot does it again by looking into the near future and laying out what might happened due to various social/global issues that are relevant in today‚Äôs world. With his ability to research those relevant topics, expand on them to plausible future events and outcomes all while crafting other drama into the story always amazes me. Don‚Äôt get me wrong there is more to the story than just social events as friendships are tested, betrayal unfolds, and stubborn relationships rear their ugly heads. Everything centers around Zia and she must deal with them all along the way.</p>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>The one thing I appreciate about Eliot‚Äôs books is the way he sometimes weaves things from other books into the mix. I might have only caught one referring to an open-sourced software architecture üòÉ but I am sure there were more. Additionally, he finds ways to weave current locations and eating establishments that again makes the futuristic feel of this book that much closer to home.</p>
<p>I have really been enjoying Eliot‚Äôs near future books as the concepts and issues are not unrealistic to see come to fruition. Not to mention he always seems to be writing about topics that are big and bold and not just ones that change over the course of a year.</p>
<p>This is again one of those books I really can&rsquo;t recommend enough. In a time where politics seems to be guiding best practices for how we deal with climate issues, this book takes you to the near future in the path we could be on.</p>
<p>To make sure you don&rsquo;t miss out on his next books be sure to follow him on twitter (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->@EliotPeper<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) and subscribe to his newsletter from his website (<a href="http://www.eliotpeper.com/">http://www.eliotpeper.com/</a>).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As I mentioned I have read some of Eliot&rsquo;s books before and wrote about them so if you are interested to check out some of his other books go for it as you won&rsquo;t be disappointed! Here are a couple: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->True Blue (A Short Story)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bandwidth<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Borderless<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Breach<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>It seems strange trying to look back at the last year when there is so much noise clouding the past couple of days/weeks/months.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I am sure this will be shorter than some of the previous years as I feel like I have a little bit of a mental block. In fact, I was thinking about what I was going to write on the morning of what I deemed 6.2 Birthday miles but I didn‚Äôt come up with much. That is not to say that nothing has happened over the past year. Last year I wanted to focus on Embracing things more and trying to cut out things that didn&rsquo;t bring myself or my family joy. Overall, I feel like we kept moving in the right direction. We all continued to focus on things that brought us joy and in some cases started to let go of others.

<em>One last hike in before the storm rolled in and we had to leave Sedona (Airport Loop Trail, May 2019, Sedona, Arizona)</em>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
One of the things as a family we did was a last-minute trip to Arizona last May. We were not planning it at the beginning of the year but as my wife and I started to talk about it it just seemed like a great time to go visit family and also be together as a family. The week turned out great as we spent half the time with our Arizona family and then the other half in Sedona exploring all the trails. In fact, what was only going to be a one night stay we extended it to two as everyone was having so much fun.<br>

<em>Running along the Skywalker trail in the early morning hours (May 2019, Skywalker Trail, Sedona, AZ)</em>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I had a couple overseas work trips this past year and on these travels, I tried my hardest to embrace the surroundings and explore more. While traveling to China I made a point to see the Great Wall and I am happy that I braved the adventure as I found myself alone on the wall as I got there so early in the morning (thanks jet lag). Not all of my work trips had such a spectacular sight to see, however, I made the most of almost wherever I went mostly because my early morning or late afternoon runs would lead me to some interesting overlook or park.

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Speaking of running, over the past year I continued on with my running and eventually hit a goal that formulated in my mind as the year went on. In October I had hit a mark of running a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->5K a day for 365 days<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The timing of that seemed to be about perfect as I am looking back at the last 5 months since I don&rsquo;t think I could have kept it up. However, my running goals have been focused more on distance now and not the consistency of every day running. Some other benefits of my odd running achievement were that I embraced the unknown and talked about my running adventure on a podcast called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Off the Couch<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It was something new to me and when they reached out I figured why not.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
With everything that is going on in the world right now and the focus on physically distancing us and the bans on travel in place as well. I think continuing with the theme of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Embracing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> seems fitting. We are in a very interesting time where my wife and I are both working from home and we have all of the kids with us every day for what might be the end of this school year. In addition, with no after school activities or playdates with friends, this is a great time to be together as a family and do things you always feel you never have time for. My wife and I were just commenting the other day how many weekends or nights do we really have nothing going on. So we are going to embrace this time together as a family and hope we all don&rsquo;t want to kill each other in the end üòÑ.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Eric Walker on Running 5k a Day for 365 Days (Ep.39)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The episode is talking about my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->365 days of running a 5k every day<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I will give credit to Johnathan Ellsworth and Brendan Leonard the hosts for asking all the right questions to make an episode that was more than 15 min long as we joked about the start of the episode. I had a lot of fun chatting with them and feel privileged to have been on the show as I know they have had some amazing guests.</p>
<p>I hope you give the episode a listen and enjoy the conversation I had with them as I thoroughly enjoyed chatting with them. Finally, if you did enjoy it be sure to give their podcast a review on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iTunes<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to help show support for their show. I have only been a more recent listener and am enjoying it as it keeps me company while running and I really enjoy hearing all of the stories of their guests.<br>

			 <p>These days most of the reading I do is listening to someone read me a book. I have written about this before but I came across this tweet by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->James Clear<!-- raw HTML omitted --> laying out that audio is the biggest trend in books.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="ease-of-listening-using-smartphones-and-headphones">Ease of Listening using Smartphones and Headphones</h3>
<p>His first two points around the change in technology I can&rsquo;t disagree with at all. The increase/change in technology has allowed audiobooks to be much easier to listen too as the technology has provided a very low barrier of entry and use. You can take them with you on the go and not have to worry about finding a cassette or CD player. Yes, you read that right, I just said cassette player. I was in that era where we had walkmans and boomboxes. So not super compact if you wanted to go on a run or walk around the house listening to your book tape. In fact, the first vehicle I purchased out of college had both a cassette and a CD player. Now the van my wife and I just bought 2 years ago doesn&rsquo;t have either.</p>
<p>The other change in technology that is similar but not specifically called out is a change in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->media type<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. As I just discussed with audiotapes and audio CDs, that is more physical stuff you needed to carry around. I remember renting an audiobook tape from the library back in 2004 and it had 10 tapes I had to carry around. I used to make a lot of trips to Chicago from Minneapolis so this is when I first started getting into book tapes as it was a way to pass the 7 hr drive by myself. However, I would have to always make sure to flip the tape or put in the next CD. Now you don&rsquo;t even have to mess with physical media as you can just download it on your phone, or tablet and go. In addition, it is much easier to get audiobooks, you can still get them for free from the library but now instead of having to go to the library to pick up your cassettes or CDs, you can just download them from Overdrive or something else your library might be connected with. Also, if you can&rsquo;t get them from the library or don&rsquo;t want to be put on the waitlist, you can quickly buy them though Audible or other platforms and pretty much listen to it instantly.</p>

<h3 id="everyone-loves-convenience">Everyone loves Convenience</h3>
<p>The third point he makes is the one that is maybe more concerning but even more spot on. I say that it is concerning as I am one of those people. Every year I have this idea in my head I am going to physically read more books but every year I only get though enough to count on one hand. Most of the ones I read like that are advanced copies I get from a friend show writes some pretty amazing books. Honestly, it is the convenience that I continue to stick with audiobooks because I can listen to them while doing a number of other things. I still don&rsquo;t know if that is a great thing to always multitask while listening to books but I don&rsquo;t see myself changing that. Most of the time it is when I am running or driving to work. For both of those activities, audiobooks are the perfect multitasking initiative. Also, both of those activities for me have a defined starting and stopping point that doesn&rsquo;t allow it to flow into other activities.</p>
<p>Another article I was reading titled <!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚ÄúThe Rise and Rise of the Books you Don‚Äôt read‚Äù<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Clare Thorp touched on a lot of other interesting benefits around audiobooks but one part in there was a different look at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Convenience <!-- raw HTML omitted -->topic above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚ÄúOften audio <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is not <!-- raw HTML omitted -->competing with time spent with books,‚Äù says Richard Lennon, publisher at Penguin Audio. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs people who are either fitting books and authors into their day in new ways, so people who might be existing readers but have found that during their commute or exercising or cooking dinner, there‚Äôs an opportunity to listen. Or it‚Äôs an alternative to TV for people who are conscious of their screen time.‚Äù<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bingo!<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Richard validated that a lot of the times when I personally listen to books are times I would not have been sitting on the couch reading a physical book. As it would be hard to run down the streets in the morning with a physical book in my hands.</p>
<p>However, I do listen to audiobooks sometimes in the evening as I am doing small tasks around the house. The only issue with this is that it translates into not just sitting on the couch and relaxing or winding down. It then has me wandering all around the house doing various projects and tasks. Then what ultimately ends up happening is that I continue to listen to it much longer and stay up later than I was anticipating. These are the times that go against what Richard was talking about as it isn‚Äôt really a new way and I just cut out a good way to get back to physical books. In fact, these specifically are the times I should have reached for the physical book instead and the more times I don‚Äôt I find the more times I don‚Äôt even think about physical books.</p>
<h3 id="so-are-you-going-to-change-any-of-your-habits">So are you going to change any of your habits?</h3>
<p>Probably not. Honestly, I do know I am taking the easier way out by listening to books instead of physically reading them but it works for me. Maybe when I am older and have some more time on my hands to sit by a fire or on my couch in the afternoon I will read more physical (or even digital) books.</p>
<p>For now, they are a good companion while running and driving to work so I don&rsquo;t see that changing. The only thing I might try to change very slightly is to listen to less in the evening in a way to either try to read a physical book or do something else with my time.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A couple weeks ago I was on what I called a mini sabbatical but in reality, it was just a week off of work before I started a new job. During that week I fully appreciate and understand why rest is important. I think the overall concept of time away from work is something more companies should figure out how to offer. I know some companies have programs like actual sabbaticals after putting in a number of years at companies. I think the idea is great and I think it could be something done on a smaller scale too. I think the most important aspect is to figure out how to allow people to have some time away from where they can really disconnect.</p>
<p>Disconnecting is what you hear about all the time now and after a week of being fully disconnected, I know there are benefits there. I have always taken time away to spend time with family and I would say I was ‚Äúdisconnecting‚Äù from work. However, I was never truly disconnected. I was still getting work emails on my phone and more often than not I carried my work laptop with me to where I was going. So in theory as much as I was saying I was ‚Äúdisconnected‚Äù I was still connected by checking and making sure nothing went wrong back at work while I was away. Even if I wasn‚Äôt responding to anything, I was still glancing through things to make sure nothing big was going on and filling stuff away in order to make it easier for when I got back to work.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However, on this ‚Äúbreak‚Äù I didn‚Äôt have email or work issues that came up or even could be brought my attention. When I left work on my final day, my email and connection to that job disappeared as well. I was unemployed as I was in between jobs and it was great. I was hoping that my wife and I could have escaped somewhere fun for a couple of days but seeing how this wasn‚Äôt planned very far in advance. So my wife still had to work and the kids still had school and their normal after-school activities.</p>
<p>However, that was honestly perfect for me as it allowed me to do more with the kids before and after school as I was still there. However, it also gave me a chance to just do random things during the day from 9am - 4pm when my kids were at school. I took the dog to the dog park where she was just in heaven as there wasn&rsquo;t anyone there and she could just run around as fast as possible.</p>

<p>I spent the week doing things I enjoyed but honestly, I could have had another week to get even more stuff done as I had planned on taking the time to read a book (yep never happened). I did make sure to sneak in a couple of long runs, multiple runs per day, as well as a fun park that was a lot of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hill running<!-- raw HTML omitted --> but worth the views.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In fact, I even met up with my cousin for a run one of the days I was off. It was good to get outside as well as catch up with her.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Finally, I took my wife out on a couple of lunch dates where we could take our time eating and just enjoy each other&rsquo;s company with nothing big to rush to the next event or worry we are paying some babysitter to allow our kids to watch TV at home :).</p>
<p>I am sad that my time away from work is over as I am now three weeks into my new job. However, I am going to think of ways going forward that I can take a week off and just be at home as disconnected as I can. Another thought is to just take some random days off here and there where I can just do my own thing without other priorities or reasons for taking the day off. I believe that would allow me to be refocused and refreshed going back to work the next day.</p>
