				"content_html": "\n\n<p>Two weeks ago I decided to set off on completing a <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/01/xx-running-challenge.html\">4x4x40</a> as part of some crazy ideas for my 40th birthday year. However, after I reached the 40 miles I felt like I really needed to continue as I figured at that point I might never do this again and get so close to hitting the real number and completing a 4x4x48 (run 4 miles every 4 hours for 48 hours). Maybe it helped that I was a bit sleep deprived at the time and not thinking clearly as I figured what was two more 4 mile runs at that point.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/d0d7eda4b0.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Since I posted after each of my runs with a short photo, time, and thought I will not rehash all of them. I don’t want to make light of this challenge as I think it was hard but the miles themselves weren’t the worst for me. Some of that could have been that I didn’t really have a pace per mile in mind. I obviously wasn’t going to try to run the fastest 4 miles I could every time. However, in my mind, I wanted to keep all of my averages per run under 9 min/miles. The biggest struggle for me during this challenge was trying to fit it in during a normal working day. Due to the weather forecast and maybe my last-minute planning, as it was December, I did it during the middle of a workweek. So I scheduled it out earlier in the week and pretty much created an appointment for myself every 4 hrs. It worked great the first day but the second day some things came up at work so I had to shrink down one of my 3 hr blocks of <em>recovery</em> and extend other ones. I still was able to get the run in that 4 hr bock but I wasn’t as consistently on the hour as I was the first day of running. In a way, I am wondering if working both days helped me keep my focus away from running and how tired I might have been as I was doing things I needed to do during the day. Then in the evenings I still helped get the kids to activities and stuff.</p>\n\n<p>Now obviously the lack of sleep is one thing but the worst time of runs for me was the 5am runs that I did. I think it is because after the late-night 1am run it always took me longer than anticipated to fall asleep. You would have thought I would have been tired enough to just get into the house and fall asleep. I am guessing that the kick of adrenaline that was in my body messed with allowing my brain to shut down at that time. So for both days by the time I would will myself to sleep and it would work I think I only got 1 hr before I would have to wake up at 5am to run. After that run, I would just start my day and didn’t try to get any more rest as my youngest gets on the bus at 7am.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, I have never run so many miles in two days. It ended up being 48.9 miles due to one run when I put my trust in a running friend who lead me astray by an extra mile. Those two days were more mileage than I had completed any week during my marathon training this past year. It was an interesting challenge as it took careful planning as I still worked and helped with kid activities like a normal day. It was just I ran every 4 hrs 😁. The day after I was done I felt pretty wiped out from most likely lack of sleep and over-exercise. Fast forward two weeks later and I am back on track. Maybe I will do another one of these challenges someday but probably no time soon. At least for the rest of this year, it will be back to the normal scheduled running for me.<br />\n<br></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"full-data-of-runs-links-to-posts-and-strava\">Full Data of Runs - Links to Posts and Strava</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/01/running-log-xx.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 1/10 (1:01 am)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6328757476\">4.02 miles at 8:39/mi pace, 36°F 🌧</a></em><br /></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/01/183000.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 2/10 (5:02 am)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6329422080\">4.02 miles at 8:55/mi pace, 37°F 🌘🌥</a></em><br /></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/01/184500.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 3/10 (9:00 am)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6330251888\">4.01 miles at 8:51/mi pace, 36°F 🌥</a></em><br /></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/01/191500.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 4/10 (1:01 pm)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6331221972\">4.02 miles at 8:33/mi pace, 45°F ☁️</a></em><br /></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/01/193000.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 5/10 (4:41 pm)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6331966369\">4.02 miles at 8:59/mi pace, 50°F 🌥</a></em><br /></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/01/214806.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 6/10 (7:57 pm)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6332480665\">4.01 miles at 8:31/mi pace, 48°F 🌥</a></em><br /></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/02/running-log-xx.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 7/10 (1:02 am)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6332890004\">4.02 miles at 8:47/mi pace, 47°F ☁️</a></em><br /></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/02/055602.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 8/10 (5:04 am)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6333540689\">4.02 miles at 8:59/mi pace, 40°F 🌌</a></em><br /></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/02/113029.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 9/10 (9:52 am)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6334553267\"> 4.02 miles at 8:35/mi pace, 38°F ☀️</a></em><br /></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/02/143306.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 10/10 (12:58 pm)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6335309327\">4.69 miles at 8:06/mi pace, 45°F ☁️</a></em><br /></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/02/180000.html\">Running Log: 4x4x44 - 11/10 (4:46 pm)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6336063574\">4.03 miles at 8:27/mi pace, 41°F ☁️</a></em><br /></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/02/220254.html\">Running Log: 4x4x48 - 12/10 (8:51 pm)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6336606100\">4.03 miles at 8:35/mi pace, 39°F 🌧</a></em><br /></li>\n</ul>\n",

By using Brendan&rsquo;s and others&rsquo; relatable running stories it frames up challenges all of us face to just get motivated to do things in life. There are always obstacles in the way, better things to do, or thinking we are too busy to do something. As a &ldquo;runner&rdquo; myself, I can personally relate to the specific stories of running as no matter how much I love running, being outdoors, It is much better to have the run done and behind me as I too am someone that struggles most of the time to just get out the door.  Specific to running, everyone has their own story and reasons why they run and Brendan also explores that as part of the book.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://semi-rad.com/2021/03/people-who-get-to-decide-what-the-point-of-all-your-running-is/\"><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/b9999d81da.jpg\" width=\"390\" height=\"390\" alt=\"People who get to decide what the point of all your Running is - Brendan Leonard\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Now I am a fan of Brendan Leonard fan of his work from his site <a href=\"https://semi-rad.com\">Semi-Rad</a>, and this book did not disappoint. That being said, I have seen some of these graphs before but the rest of the story and context is short, witty, and perfectly sized for most of us to get through in a timely manor.</p>\n\n<p>One of my favorite parts of the book is when he is talking about what he calls the &ldquo;invisible work&rdquo; which in the context of the book is all of the miles and hours you put in before a race or event. In fact, for someone like myself who is planning on running a <a href=\"https://micro.upnorth.blog/2021/07/08/it-is-official.html\">Marathon</a> later this year, I have already run about 37 marathons with the number of miles I have put in so far.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Inspiration is for amateurs. The rest of us just show up and get to work. - Chuck Close</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Overall, I couldn&rsquo;t recommend this book more but honestly don&rsquo;t just take my word for it and pick up a <a href=\"https://semi-rad.com/books/\">copy from the links on his website</a>. The best thing is it is a smaller-sized book so you can carry it with you on all of your adventures (well maybe not while running) so you can refer to the helpful motivational kick in the butt that is needed from time to time while doing anything. Honestly, I wish I had this book a couple of years back when I was content with just running a <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/09/30/k-a-day.html\">5k a day</a> as some days were harder to get motivated than others. As I am now running longer miles with slightly less frequency, I feel like this book helps keep me motivated to get out there.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I have always liked the idea of an exercise bike. In fact, last December when my wife was talking about buying one over a treadmill I told her to go for it. I assumed since I run so much outside in all kinds of weather why would I choose to run inside and not really moving? I mean, I like to explore the outdoors in all seasons. Snow, Ice, Ran, wicked winds all of those don't deter me if I am planning on running or want to run. Even in smog-filled cities or cities, I don't even know where I am going I prefer to run outside than on the treadmill. So easy enough a bike for indoors makes sense then... Or does it...</p>\n<p>Over the past year, I have used the exercise bike 4 times, yep only 4, and one of them was in the first couple of days trying it out and the most recent time was today 😁. Don't get me wrong it isn't like the bike is buried away somewhere in the house so it is out of sight out of mind. In fact quite the opposite, since I have been working from home since March, it is in the same room as me so I can't really say I forgot about it 😁.</p>\n<p>After some reflection and conversation with friends, I realized I would have been better off with a treadmill. It wouldn't have taken the place of my running, well maybe once or twice but ultimately I could have been walking on it while on phone calls or watching TV. The times when I can't leave the house for a run but could move at a moderate clip to get some exercise in.</p>\n<p>\n  Now you might be thinking you could do the same with an exercise bike Eric! And yes, that is true but the difference is the key...\n  <br />\n</p>\n<p>\n  <b><i>You have to keep moving or you will fall on the treadmill vs exercise bike you can slow to a stop and not give the same movement or output.</i></b>\n</p>\n<p>That right there is my answer. On a treadmill, you have to just let your subconscious take over to keep your legs moving at the pace you set. If not well it might not end well...</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/3cff2b39c7.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n<p>On the bike, however, I have to monitor the pace and use brainpower to have my legs move at the speed I want because the bike will not keep moving and pushing me forward. That right there gives me too much room to fail.</p>\n<p>It isn't that I am not determined in my workouts or exercise routines. It is just I am smart about it, I know my body and sometimes I need to trick it or force its hand. A couple of weeks back I was thinking I should run further but wasn't sure I really wanted to. So what did I do? I ran more or less a loop that requires me to run the whole thing in order to get back. No short cuts or stopping early. The distance was going to be the distance so I might as well run it.</p>\n<p>So for me, Treadmills &gt; Exercise Bikes when it comes to a mindless activity to get your body moving.</p>\n",

You will quickly find out in short drifting is just following along the status quo or coasting through life accepting everything that is happening.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large\"><p><i>“People do not decide their futures, they decide their habits and their habits decide their futures.”</i> </p><cite> <em>F.M. Alexander </em> </cite></blockquote>\n\n<p>As someone who has written about <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/02/19/power-of-the.html\">habits</a> before and not long ago had a very addicting habit that added up to <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/09/30/k-a-day.html\">a lot of miles being run</a>, I was very interested in seeing what the author had to say. Not too far into the book he hits you with some quick questions like <em>\"Are you feeling bored? Restless? Trapped?\"</em> and if your answers are yes then the solution is that <i><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">It's Time to Take Back Control of Your Life</span></i>.</p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell, that is what the book is really based on. The nice thing about this book, in my opinion, is that it is short and very consumable. However, not too short that he doesn't add some examples throughout each topic. However, It is really broken down into 4 parts which have simple enough concepts:</p>\n\n<h3>Awakening</h3>\n\n<p>Being aware as you cannot change what you are not aware of. Uncover the habits that are operating in your blind spots. Once your habits are brought out into light you can inspect them and disrupt them.</p>\n\n<h3>Disrupting</h3>\n\n<p>Disrupting is the process of interrupting your perpetual patterns and breaking the stimulus and response cycle. When you do this, you get immediate and profound feedback on why you do what you do, and how these habits may be serving or oppressing you.</p>\n\n<h3>Designing</h3>\n\n<p>The first two parts of the book are pretty straightforward as he talks about how to pretty much break down your current habits and thinking in order to get to the designing part. In the designing chapter he talks a lot about Ultimate authority and how to set compelling goals. This is where he talks about creating new habits that empower your future.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><i>Ultimate authority means taking responsibility for the fact that your life is the sum total of every decision you’ve ever made from the day you were born up until this very moment. This means you get to take credit for the many successes you’ve had. It also means the shit parts of your life are on you too.</i></p></blockquote>\n\n<h3>Sustaining</h3>\n\n<p>The part of the book I think makes the most sense. Obviously, if you have completed the above topics then you have to figure out a way to keep moving forward.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><i><b>The Awakening, Disrupting and Designing (ADD) Cycle we have just walked through in this book is a process that should be repeated and not a one-time exercise.</b></i></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>The above statement by the author was a great strategic point to make towards the end of the book for a reminder about sustaining. There are a lot of things we do in life thinking if we just do it once all is good. However, in reality, we need to continue to work on things no matter if it is trying to rid ourselves of excess possessions, weight, or anything else. Each day is a new day that you really have to tackle the problem again. The advantage you have as you build up the consecutive days is that it becomes a habit and less you might have to think about in the future.</p>\n\n<h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>\n\n<p>Overall, I enjoyed the book and if anything it made me think about various things I do and maybe things I have been thinking about changing or doing in my life but haven’t taken that next step. I really did enjoy that the book was a quick read as I could see myself flipping through the pages again at some point in time as it gives off a measure of motivation too.</p>\n\n<p>If you think the book would be interesting to you, it can be found on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077K9J6PT\">Amazon</a> or through the publisher’s website (<a href=\"https://www.tckpublishing.com/\">TCK Publishing</a>).</p>\n",

I do think how he accomplished them is very interesting and sheds some light on how he thought about things differently during his command. In fact, many of his stories are how he tried doing something one way only to talk through and come up with a better way. It goes to show you that he too was learning through the process from day one.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n\n<p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><b><em>Of course, trying something new is never easy. For one thing, there aren’t any precedents to guide you. And that can be a very good thing.</em></b></p><cite>Captain D. Michael Abrashoff</cite></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Now, as much as I enjoyed the book I feel how it was laid out did not necessarily flow as well as I would have liked as I feel he repeated himself from time to time. The reason for that is obvious as he was breaking down chapters into Management topics and not in the chronological order that events happened. It is just something to think about as sometimes I was trying to figure out in what order he started to do certain things or implementing new tactics.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n\n<p><h2>Takeaways</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Different than some of my other book reviews I am going to just write out a couple of notes I took that may or may not be helpful to you. Now as I mentioned the book is very focused from a managers prespective. However, the notes I took could be turned inward as well. Depending on your line of business or work you do because in all honesty aren’t we kind of an employee even if it is for ourselves?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>As I read the book the following themes stuck out to me that could be used in any situation depending on how you read it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n\n<p><h4>Lead by Example</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>This seems to go without saying. Can you actually do what you are asking others to do? Also, if you got different results than you were expecting to ask yourself his simple questions:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n\n<p><ol><li>Did I clearly articulate the goals?</li><li>Did I give people enough time and resources to accomplish the task?</li><li>Did I give them enough training?</li><li>Listen Aggressively</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Abrashoff got personal in his discussions with the crew while learning about their personal lives, why they joined the Navy and their thoughts on how to improve the ship. By taking the time to listen and not just give orders he discovered that he had a crew of smart, talented, and innovative men and women, but they weren’t being heard. This can be true in many interactions today, sometimes the best thing to do is listen to the other people instead of making sure your voice is heard. You might find something out that can be more beneficial to your purpose or goal.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n\n<p><h4>Communicate with Purpose</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>No matter how fantastic your message is, if no one is receiving it, you aren’t communicating. It is up to you to clearly define the mission and vision of the organization and then to communicate clearly and concisely.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n\n<p><h4>Take risks</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Everyone in an organization must feel comfortable taking calculated risks. The key is to know the parameters in which they can take those calculated risks and that everyone understands that you might not always win. Remember to not over encourage perfection as it will limit your ability to think creatively and take risks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n\n<p><h4>Praise</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>As a manager myself I found this one spot on with his quote.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n\n<p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><i><b>Show me a manager that ignores the power of praise and I will show you a lousy manager, praise is infinitely more powerful than punishment.</b></i></p><cite>Captain D. Michael Abrashoff</cite></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>However, as with most of these points above, the simple act of giving praise to someone even if you don’t have a working relationship as the book describes can go a long way. There are a lot of people putting stuff out there and the act of giving recognition might seem small for you but 100x the effect for the person receiving it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n\n<p><h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>I would recommend this book as I found it an interesting read with a couple of good takeaways.  I don&rsquo;t think this book is for everyone as some of the takeaways can be found in other books.

The story does a great job laying out examples of how Captain Abrashoff took a poor performing ship in the navy to become one of the sought after ships people wanted to be assigned to.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":51123417,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"custom\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Its-Your-Ship-Management-Techniques-ebook/dp/B001HPW9R4/?tag=stthink-20\"><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/3afb243583.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-51123417\"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Even though most of the concepts are not new in this book nor do I think the author claimed that the methods he used were entirely his own. I do think how he accomplished them is very interesting and sheds some light on how he thought about things differently during his command. In fact, many of his stories are how he tried doing something one way only to talk through and come up with a better way. It goes to show you that he too was learning through the process from day one.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><b><em>Of course, trying something new is never easy. For one thing, there aren’t any precedents to guide you. And that can be a very good thing.</em></b></p><cite>Captain D. Michael Abrashoff</cite></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, as much as I enjoyed the book I feel how it was laid out did not necessarily flow as well as I would have liked as I feel he repeated himself from time to time. The reason for that is obvious as he was breaking down chapters into Management topics and not in the chronological order that events happened. It is just something to think about as sometimes I was trying to figure out in what order he started to do certain things or implementing new tactics.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Takeaways</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Different than some of my other book reviews I am going to just write out a couple of notes I took that may or may not be helpful to you. Now as I mentioned the book is very focused from a managers prespective. However, the notes I took could be turned inward as well. Depending on your line of business or work you do because in all honesty aren’t we kind of an employee even if it is for ourselves?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As I read the book the following themes stuck out to me that could be used in any situation depending on how you read it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Lead by Example</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This seems to go without saying. Can you actually do what you are asking others to do? Also, if you got different results than you were expecting to ask yourself his simple questions:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>Did I clearly articulate the goals?</li><li>Did I give people enough time and resources to accomplish the task?</li><li>Did I give them enough training?</li><li>Listen Aggressively</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Abrashoff got personal in his discussions with the crew while learning about their personal lives, why they joined the Navy and their thoughts on how to improve the ship. By taking the time to listen and not just give orders he discovered that he had a crew of smart, talented, and innovative men and women, but they weren’t being heard. This can be true in many interactions today, sometimes the best thing to do is listen to the other people instead of making sure your voice is heard. You might find something out that can be more beneficial to your purpose or goal.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Communicate with Purpose</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>No matter how fantastic your message is, if no one is receiving it, you aren’t communicating. It is up to you to clearly define the mission and vision of the organization and then to communicate clearly and concisely.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Take risks</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Everyone in an organization must feel comfortable taking calculated risks. The key is to know the parameters in which they can take those calculated risks and that everyone understands that you might not always win. Remember to not over encourage perfection as it will limit your ability to think creatively and take risks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Praise</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As a manager myself I found this one spot on with his quote.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><i><b>Show me a manager that ignores the power of praise and I will show you a lousy manager, praise is infinitely more powerful than punishment.</b></i></p><cite>Captain D. Michael Abrashoff</cite></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, as with most of these points above, the simple act of giving praise to someone even if you don’t have a working relationship as the book describes can go a long way. There are a lot of people putting stuff out there and the act of giving recognition might seem small for you but 100x the effect for the person receiving it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I would recommend this book as I found it an interesting read with a couple of good takeaways.  I don't think this book is for everyone as some of the takeaways can be found in other books. However, I enjoyed hearing the stories of how Captain Abrashoff achieved his success.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>A couple weeks ago I was on what I called a mini sabbatical but in reality, it was just a week off of work before I started a new job. During that week I fully appreciate and understand why rest is important. I think the overall concept of time away from work is something more companies should figure out how to offer. I know some companies have programs like actual sabbaticals after putting in a number of years at companies. I think the idea is great and I think it could be something done on a smaller scale too. I think the most important aspect is to figure out how to allow people to have some time away from where they can really disconnect.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Disconnecting is what you hear about all the time now and after a week of being fully disconnected, I know there are benefits there. I have always taken time away to spend time with family and I would say I was “disconnecting” from work. However, I was never truly disconnected.

I know some companies have programs like actual sabbaticals after putting in a number of years at companies. I think the idea is great and I think it could be something done on a smaller scale too.

Not only do I get to help keep the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Break the Twitch website (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.breakthetwitch.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Break the Twitch website</a> and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"podcast (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.breakthetwitch.com/podcast-overview/\" target=\"_blank\">Podcast</a> ad-free but also get access to an amazing community of supporting individuals and other resources. In the community specifically, you will find both Anthony and his wife Amy who are active by either leading and/or contributing to discussions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":51123309,\"align\":\"center\",\"width\":384,\"height\":384} -->\n\n<p><div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/upnorth.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/break-the-twitch-logo.jpg?fit=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Break The Twitch Logo\" class=\"wp-image-51123309\" width=\"384\" height=\"384\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Now time to interrupt my normal style of writing with some questions and answering in order to fill in the blanks of why this post exists.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n\n<p><h4><i>This is great why are you telling me this, is it a sales pitch? Are you going to get a commission on this?</i></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p><b><u>NO</u></b> and <b><u>NO</u></b>. This is not a sales pitch and I don’t get anything if you would happen to sign up. Well, I guess technically I get to have you in the community if you sign up so that is something. The real reason I am talking about the Break the Twitch Member Community is to get the word out there. I have been a part of the community for almost 2 years and figured it was time to give a little extra back as I realized that I have never talked about it or said I had joined.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n\n<p><h4><i>So why did you join?</i></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>It seems like a fair place to start out. I have been part of communities before and the best communities are made better by the people in them. Each member (the creators are included in this one) is supporting each other along their own journey. Some of our journies are the same but others are wildly different. That doesn’t matter though because the other members can help become your support system for you to do the tasks or things that matter most.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>When I originally joined there were not many of us as it just launched. I didn’t hesitate as I have followed Break the Twitch for years and felt like this way one way for me to give back to a creator trying to create something to help people. Also, I believed in what Anthony was saying from the beginning. A little fun fact, I looked back in all of the posts I have had on this site and I have talked about Break the Twitch more times than I remembered (<a href=\"https://upnorth.blog/2018/12/one-decision/\">One Decision</a>, <a href=\"https://upnorth.blog/2016/02/power-of-the-habit/\">Power of the Habit</a>, <a href=\"https://upnorth.blog/2017/10/fall-clean-up-and-clean-out/\">Fall Clean up and Clean out</a>).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n\n<p><h4><i>I have been part of Communities before and they sometimes fizzle or conversations die out. How is the BTT Community and why would it be better?</i></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>I too have been part of other communities before and in fact, started one that I feel is in that dying out phase of life (more on that other time). By my own experiences in communities, I have found that the best communities need champions and that is where you have Anthony and Amy actively engaging with people in the community. Not to mention all of the other members have some motivation to be active as well because there was a reason we all joined, to begin with. Additionally, since everyone is paying something to be a part of it that brings an increased level of commitment on everyone&rsquo;s part.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n\n<p><h4><i>Sounds great but I don’t really want to be active in a community right now or what if I get busy and can’t be active in the community. Wouldn’t that mean I will not really be getting my value?</i></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Another great question and to be honest I am that person a lot of the time. I will not lie I am not the best community contributor. I come in and out of discussions all of the time. It is not that I don’t find value in the discussion or monthly challenges they have. Trust me they are all great things, but for me, it comes down to my other priorities and which one fits for me at the given month/time. There is always value to be gained as the Break the Twitch Membership allows you access to a library of Audio courses that you have access to all the time. For someone that travels and spending a lot of time running around the streets, these courses are great to load on my phone and hit the road.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n\n<p><h4><i>Didn’t you meet Anthony? Is that skewing your thoughts here?</i></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Yes, and no. I did meet Anthony for the first time a couple of years back before the Membership community was open. As I said before I had been following Break the Twitch for some time and since we lived in the same area it made it easy to meet up. Meeting him in person confirmed what I had originally thought that he seemed like a super easy to talk to, down to earth, and overall really nice guy. I would have joined the membership community even if I had never met him. However, I will say the way he presents himself on the podcast, and in the Member Community group is how he is in real life.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Speaking of meeting with him, now granted you might not be able to meet him in person as I did, but after signing up you can take him up on the offer of a 20 min coaching call. Not to mention you can interact with him in the Community chat group.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n\n<p><h4><i>Final Thoughts</i></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Hope you enjoyed this different style of post today.

				"content_html": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>I have used my <a href=\"https://www.fitbit.com/\">Fitbit</a> since January 2014 after what I remember was a long time trying to decide if I really wanted one and if so which one. Thinking back it has served its purpose well and I will give it some credit for keeping me active over the past years.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:image -->\n\n<p><figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/fbb67d0c2e.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Over the course of the timeline above, I used a handful of watches. Most I bought because I wanted GPS capabilities however I did own two that were only step counters. From the data above you are probably wondering why there is a big gap in 2014. Long story short after I decided on getting a Fitbit at the end of 2013, I went for the new Fitbit force since it could actually show the time as I thought it was silly to just have a tracker band on my wrist. Unfortunately for me, I had issues with that watch and had to return it. At that time they didn’t have a replacement as all of them were recalled so they just returned my money in Full.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n\n<p><h2>Positives</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n\n<p><h4>Community</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Due to the fact, Fitbit was kind of a pioneer in the step tracking market, a lot of people jumped on board quickly. I don’t recall when they started their community to connect with people and have challenges but it has been for as long as I can remember. This is something they did well early on too as it encouraged people to do more in order to try to keep up with family or friends. I enjoyed looking at where people&rsquo;s 7-day averages were and how well I did against them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n\n<p><h4>Customer Support</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Hands down the one thing Fitbit has done (at least from my perspective) from day one is having great customer support. Put aside the question of quality as remember early on this was a new type of technology.

However, in reality, the underlying message was not to just trash everything and live in a house with nothing. No… because who would really want to do that. The course walked you through how to figure out what is important to you and helps challenge your thinking of what is important so in the end, you hopefully will know exactly what is important and lift the weight by removing the other “stuff” cluttering your life.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>The best part about the course is that you get lifetime access. So for someone like me, I enjoy that because I have done the course a couple of different times. Not only as a refresher but also as a way to get motivated again. As I said at the beginning of this article, I have two big clean-up events every year due to the infrastructure of outside stuff I need to put away. I am approaching one right now and even though I would love to say I decluttered our house once and after that, all was well… Well, that is not the case, it is something you have to intentionally work at going forward because let&rsquo;s face it everyone is busy and stuff can start to pile up again.

Not only did the book energize me to start some of those decluttering projects around my house but also the book gave me access to a course that connected me with a community of people who wanted to and were going through the same process.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":51123250,\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/1f973eaa3c.jpg\" alt=\"2019 Uncluttered\" class=\"wp-image-51123250\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://uncluttered.samcart.com/referral/kwVBIyfN/KLDewKhkPXB2B00D\">Uncluttered</a> was the course and it was great because it was only a 12-week course focusing on various aspects of becoming uncluttered. However, in reality, the underlying message was not to just trash everything and live in a house with nothing. No… because who would really want to do that. The course walked you through how to figure out what is important to you and helps challenge your thinking of what is important so in the end, you hopefully will know exactly what is important and lift the weight by removing the other “stuff” cluttering your life.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The best part about the course is that you get lifetime access. So for someone like me, I enjoy that because I have done the course a couple of different times. Not only as a refresher but also as a way to get motivated again. As I said at the beginning of this article, I have two big clean-up events every year due to the infrastructure of outside stuff I need to put away. I am approaching one right now and even though I would love to say I decluttered our house once and after that, all was well… Well, that is not the case, it is something you have to intentionally work at going forward because let's face it everyone is busy and stuff can start to pile up again. So for me retaking this course that continues to inspire me is time and initial money well spent.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><i>Ok, I need to make something clear because I do not want you to think I am trying to pull one over on you.

Finally, in the late April / May timeframe it was starting to get nicer out that I could do more trails around the area. In May especially, I was traveling and was running in the hills of Arizona, streets of China and a number of Treadmill runs due to the arrival of flights.

I was thinking of doing a chart like some of the above but I realized I didn&rsquo;t really have good data around this.

To both of those facts, I might have been a little short-sided, as looking back I would have done things differently in order to make sure I had the data easily available. I would not have used it to change what happened on a day to day basis as my goal was never to run faster or even longer. I did use my Strava data and my Fitbit data to just look back at a given week or compare runs every now and then to see if there was any small progress.

Not to mention if you want to have a drink with the neighbor while grilling after work on a Friday it is best to get you run in early ?.</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I also did a similar slice based on miles but as you can see it didn’t really tell me anything as the chart looks about the same since I was always hovering around 3.1 miles with very rare exceptions though most of and then at the end.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/ef806307e5.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Pace</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally, after I was pulling all this data together I was wondering what was my average pace over the course of these 12 months. The overall answer is 7:47 min miles. I decided to create some quick average charts by day and month. The day chart kind of puzzled me except when thinking about the other data above. I most likely got better rest before my Saturday run as I didn’t always have to do it at dawn.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/3800be7ba7.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you look at the monthly chart this is even more interesting but I have a few ideas of why it might look like it does.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/69003594bd.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>From when I started till about January I was on a steady decline.

In addition, I would run sometimes with my daughter who would like to bike along with me and sometimes she just wanted to stop. Finally, in the late April / May timeframe it was starting to get nicer out that I could do more trails around the area. In May especially, I was traveling and was running in the hills of Arizona, streets of China and a number of Treadmill runs due to the arrival of flights. I know that Treadmill run data was about the worst because I only have my watch data to go on and most of the time it never said I ran as far as the treadmill said I did.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So after all of my analysis above, I got to thinking I might be missing some data here that might be in addition to the chart above. The one above only gave average pace but I was more curious about what the min and max were as well. I think this chart helps answer some of those questions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/7ee112f17d.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Looking at the chart above I think it further supports my hypothesis of running in different places and on the treadmill.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Fastest Times</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:table {\"align\":\"right\",\"className\":\"is-style-stripes\"} -->\n<table class=\"wp-block-table alignright is-style-stripes\"><tbody><tr><th>Best Efforts</th></tr><tr><td>1k</td><td><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/2586825202#5474197455\">4:05</a></td></tr><tr><td>1 mile</td><td><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/2586825202#5474197456\">6:36</a></td></tr><tr><td>5k</td><td><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/2586825202#5474197458\">20:58</a></td></tr><tr><td>10k</td><td><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/2754168500#5824679526\">46:39</a></td></tr></tbody></table>\n<!-- /wp:table -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I figured since I was sharing all of this data anyways I should probably share some Personal Bests during my year of running. I was thinking of doing a chart like some of the above but I realized I didn't really have good data around this. Mostly because I didn't always stop running right at 3.1 miles, so it would be hard with the data I have to give more meaning than overall bests.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Luckily, Strava has some overall personal bests that I could easily get and all of them except for the 10k came from a race I did in the summer. In looking at the data now, I wish I would have broken the 20 min mark but I can't really complain as I was never shooting for a specific time. Also, I did well as I was in the top 15 overall and  2nd in my age group. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I actually did 2 races over the past year and surprised myself during both of them with good enough times considering I was running every day with no breaks. Running a 5k a day made me realize that running those 5K races were really nothing. I did them every day so it wasn't a big deal, I knew I would finish it so then it was just a matter of at what point in the race should I pick up my pace or pass someone.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I never really set out to put any data together when I originally started running. In fact, I didn’t really think about it when I realized that I was actually going to be running for a year. To both of those facts, I might have been a little short-sided, as looking back I would have done things differently in order to make sure I had the data easily available. I would not have used it to change what happened on a day to day basis as my goal was never to run faster or even longer. I did use my Strava data and my Fitbit data to just look back at a given week or compare runs every now and then to see if there was any small progress. However, my ultimate goal was the consistency of doing it every day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

After, the month I figured I should do it for 3 months as that put me in January and I figured it would be too cold then.

I found myself running early in the morning, late at night, and sometimes squeezing it in while my son was at a birthday party. Then there was the weather. That would always through a wrench in it if I would have let it. However, after my habit was formed I just told myself it didn’t matter the weather, rain or shine, snow or ice, 100 degrees and humid or 0 degrees with a negative windchill, I would make sure to get my run in.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n\n<p><h2>Around the Neighborhood</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Something that I have enjoyed over the past 4 years of running is exploring my surroundings.

I found myself running early in the morning, late at night, and sometimes squeezing it in while my son was at a birthday party. Then there was the weather. That would always through a wrench in it if I would have let it. However, after my habit was formed I just told myself it didn’t matter the weather, rain or shine, snow or ice, 100 degrees and humid or 0 degrees with a negative windchill, I would make sure to get my run in.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Around the Neighborhood</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Something that I have enjoyed over the past 4 years of running is exploring my surroundings. In my neighborhood, I have found so many small parks, trails, and green spaces that I didn’t know existed in the first 6 years we lived there. Mostly because I would just drive by and not give it a second look. However, by increasing my mileage as well as the frequency of runs, I found myself exploring more places because I needed more routes and I was going farther.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, in my town and some of the surrounding areas, I went to other parks not near my house in order to find a new and interesting place to run. Some of which I then took my family back to so would could all explore at a later time to really take in the scenery.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery {\"ids\":[51123075,51123079,51122848,51123207,51123206],\"linkTo\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-3 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/2221133496.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"51123075\" data-link=\"https://upnorth.blog/img_20190606_164651-01/\" class=\"wp-image-51123075\"/><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-item__caption\">Enjoying the new scenery on an early evening run that was a lot harder than I anticipated (June 2019, Richard T.

In fact, I am currently writing this while flying back to the US and probably won&rsquo;t spend a lot of time editing it or polishing it up. Just some random observations.</i></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>People are always worried about how connected they are and how much they are doing things on their phones or devices in the US. My wife and I are included in this as we try to model good behavior of device usage at home and try not to be too dependent on it so we can be present for our kids. However, using my phone as a camera I knowingly pull it out of my pocket quite a bit so I can snap a picture of the kids or a beautiful landscape. I always feel I could do better here but after traveling for the past week I have started to realize our problem might not be as bad as we all think it is.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":51123065,\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n\n<p><div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/3b6ff5c1e4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-51123065\"/><figcaption>Photo credit <a href=\"https://travelsovertoys.com/\">Travels Over Toys</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>I have spent the last week in China where I was both in Shanghai and Beijing. Below are a couple of observations I have noticed about device usage.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n\n<p><h4>Walking in the Streets</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>While in China it didn’t stop me from running, even though my wife and mom thought I shouldn’t be out early in the morning running the streets of China. Not only from a safety perspective but air pollution as well. Don’t worry I am safely on a plane back to the US so all is well. On my first morning running, I noticed there was relatively no one out in the streets but it was bright enough outside to be 8 am back home. On that first day, 5 people almost walked right into me as they were deeply in thought of what was on their screen and facing down. Remember I was running and not being super stealthy trying to sneak up on anyone so they for sure had to have heard my feet hitting the brick pavement. You would think as that noise came closer to them they might consider looking up. However, not only did they not look up even when I was right next to them, they were just drifting along with their nose to the screen.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n\n<p><h4>Eating Lunch</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Eating lunch with my co-workers the first day I remember glancing around the restaurant and everyone at every other table had their phones out and looking down. I won&rsquo;t say we don&rsquo;t do that in the US but it seemed like a lot more than where I live. Now some of this could just be Shanghai is a bigger city than the Minneapolis area and if I lived in a downtown setting I might notice this more often. That might be some of it but I am not 100% sure that is the whole reason as I have done my fair share of traveling in the US as well.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n\n<p><h2>My Take</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Whereas people in the US keep trying to make conscious efforts to stay away from their phones, China seems to be doing the opposite. The restaurant I was talking about earlier where everyone was on their phone some of it made more sense as I traveled more. You see in China even though you go to a restaurant and sit down, most of the time you end up ordering from your phone (thinking face). Yep, you heard that right, the people sitting at the tables and planning on eating it there ALL order and ALL pay by their phone. I can see some benefits on the payment side of things as you don&rsquo;t have to worry about them taking your credit card or dealing with cash. Also, I would assume a receipt would be instantly on your phone if you needed it for your records or business purposes. However, this whole situation is just another way to keep people engaged on their phone and not put them down.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>In talking with a colleague on a different night, she explained that now she doesn&rsquo;t even carry cash or bank cards but just always keeps her phone on her.

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph {\"fontSize\":\"small\"} -->\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><i>First I want to caveat this as there is not any detailed research or analysis done on this topic other than my own observations over the past week while traveling in China. In fact, I am currently writing this while flying back to the US and probably won't spend a lot of time editing it or polishing it up. Just some random observations.</i></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>People are always worried about how connected they are and how much they are doing things on their phones or devices in the US. My wife and I are included in this as we try to model good behavior of device usage at home and try not to be too dependent on it so we can be present for our kids. However, using my phone as a camera I knowingly pull it out of my pocket quite a bit so I can snap a picture of the kids or a beautiful landscape. I always feel I could do better here but after traveling for the past week I have started to realize our problem might not be as bad as we all think it is.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":51123065,\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/3b6ff5c1e4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-51123065\"/><figcaption>Photo credit <a href=\"https://travelsovertoys.com/\">Travels Over Toys</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have spent the last week in China where I was both in Shanghai and Beijing. Below are a couple of observations I have noticed about device usage.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Walking in the Streets</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While in China it didn’t stop me from running, even though my wife and mom thought I shouldn’t be out early in the morning running the streets of China. Not only from a safety perspective but air pollution as well. Don’t worry I am safely on a plane back to the US so all is well. On my first morning running, I noticed there was relatively no one out in the streets but it was bright enough outside to be 8 am back home. On that first day, 5 people almost walked right into me as they were deeply in thought of what was on their screen and facing down. Remember I was running and not being super stealthy trying to sneak up on anyone so they for sure had to have heard my feet hitting the brick pavement. You would think as that noise came closer to them they might consider looking up. However, not only did they not look up even when I was right next to them, they were just drifting along with their nose to the screen.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Eating Lunch</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Eating lunch with my co-workers the first day I remember glancing around the restaurant and everyone at every other table had their phones out and looking down. I won't say we don't do that in the US but it seemed like a lot more than where I live. Now some of this could just be Shanghai is a bigger city than the Minneapolis area and if I lived in a downtown setting I might notice this more often. That might be some of it but I am not 100% sure that is the whole reason as I have done my fair share of traveling in the US as well.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>My Take</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Whereas people in the US keep trying to make conscious efforts to stay away from their phones, China seems to be doing the opposite. The restaurant I was talking about earlier where everyone was on their phone some of it made more sense as I traveled more. You see in China even though you go to a restaurant and sit down, most of the time you end up ordering from your phone (thinking face). Yep, you heard that right, the people sitting at the tables and planning on eating it there ALL order and ALL pay by their phone. I can see some benefits on the payment side of things as you don't have to worry about them taking your credit card or dealing with cash. Also, I would assume a receipt would be instantly on your phone if you needed it for your records or business purposes. However, this whole situation is just another way to keep people engaged on their phone and not put them down.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In talking with a colleague on a different night, she explained that now she doesn't even carry cash or bank cards but just always keeps her phone on her. It sounds like everything is almost done by phones for them and that could be a major reason everyone seemed to be looking down. If you are in the habit of using it all the time for everything then it just becomes so ingrained in your daily life that you probably don’t even think about not looking at it when you are with others or completely alone walking the streets.

However, before I jump into my own thoughts I really think you should watch the video as he brings up some really good points on being Rich vs being Poor.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ROfBLx6bLZI\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n<h3>Recap</h3>\n\n<p>For a little recap, in case you didn’t watch the video but I really think you should, Casey boils it down to everyone has <strong><em>Life Problems</em></strong> which consist of Happiness, Love, Fulfillment, and Purpose (at a minimum). However, if you are poor on top of those problems you have the big gorilla which is <strong><em>Money Problems</em></strong> because you don’t know where you are going to live, how to put food on the table, take care of yourself when you are sick, or maybe even not sure how to get to your job without proper transportation.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/bfdfb325c4.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>If you are like me, you are going to look at that list and agree with him that it is kind of straightforward. Poorer people are worried so much about money problems that when rich people say they can’t find their purpose in life and that money can’t solve their problems, we all jump off the rails because money would solve our problems. <br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n\n<p><h3><strong>So let&rsquo;s take this one step further now….</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>There are some people that are in-between this simple concept of <strong><em>Money</em></strong> and <strong><em>Life</em></strong> problems. In fact, most people probably fall in the middle of this easy example. I would take a guess that most of us think we have some sort of Money problems.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>If we take a closer look at what we think are our money problems (or think we are poor), are we really just spending above our means. We feel we need a bigger house or extra vacations. Where in reality if we cut those out we could begin to look closer at those Life problems.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>In the video, the article that Casey references is from the NY Times and titled <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/21/magazine/elite-professionals-jobs-happiness.html\">America’s Professional Elite: Wealthy, Successful, and Miserable</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cduhigg\">Charles Duhig (@cduhigg)</a>. One part of the article that jumped out at me was a quote from the guy who made $1.2M a year and felt defeated in life said he was locked into a lifestyle that made cutting his pay impossible.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n\n<p><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>He had received an offer at a start-up, and he would have loved to take it, but it paid half as much, and he felt locked into a lifestyle that made this pay cut impossible. “My wife laughed when I told her about it,” he said.</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>That right there is the true problem of what we all feel when we have moved out of the Poor category (i.e., basic needs being taken care of), we get locked into a new version of ourselves that moving backward would feel like we failed. So our new version of poor keeps increasing with us. I am guessing most people could probably take a different job and still not be <strong><u>poor</u></strong> assuming they could get their spending and priorities in order of what is important. That is work that not everyone is willing to take and it is also something that does not change overnight. Not many people want to downsize their house or give up that yearly trip to Disney with the kids.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Over the past years, I have read a lot of articles from Personal Finance and Minimalist bloggers and the thing that always sticks out to me is the underlying topic of living true to your priorities. Some of that is figuring out what your “basic needs” or “minimum needs” are so then you can really figure out if changes can be made in your job/career to help you really tackle Life Problems that we all face. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n\n<p><h3><strong>My thoughts / Take Aways</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>I am not immune to this thing and it is something I always struggle with as I am sure most people do. My basic needs have been met so at the simplest form I really shouldn’t have any Money Problems. Moving past that, I boil it down to the two resources I have at my disposal in order to make my Life Problems either manageable or fixed. <strong>Time and Money</strong><br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Time and money are both resources at our disposal which is really all that is needed for most problems in our lives and possibly the world. The hard part is to figure out how to balance both of them in order to get an optimal outcome for yourself. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p><em>Note I said optimal outcome, as there is not always a perfect balance of having tons of money and tons of free time.</em><br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>Each of these resources is needed for prioritizing things that are important to us. For example, if you continue to upgrade your lifestyle by buying the newest gadgets, bigger houses, and fancier cars because you feel it is the most important thing to do you might find yourself in a situation of having no way out. Similar to the guy in the story from the NY Times. All of your resources are being used to tackle a lifestyle you want to achieve and I am guessing that lifestyle gives you less time and money to find love, meaning, and happiness.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n",

However, if you are poor on top of those problems you have the big gorilla which is <strong><em>Money Problems</em></strong> because you don’t know where you are going to live, how to put food on the table, take care of yourself when you are sick, or maybe even not sure how to get to your job without proper transportation.</p>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/bfdfb325c4.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you are like me, you are going to look at that list and agree with him that it is kind of straightforward. Poorer people are worried so much about money problems that when rich people say they can’t find their purpose in life and that money can’t solve their problems, we all jump off the rails because money would solve our problems. <br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>So let's take this one step further now….</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are some people that are in-between this simple concept of <strong><em>Money</em></strong> and <strong><em>Life</em></strong> problems. In fact, most people probably fall in the middle of this easy example. I would take a guess that most of us think we have some sort of Money problems.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If we take a closer look at what we think are our money problems (or think we are poor), are we really just spending above our means. We feel we need a bigger house or extra vacations. Where in reality if we cut those out we could begin to look closer at those Life problems.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the video, the article that Casey references is from the NY Times and titled <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/21/magazine/elite-professionals-jobs-happiness.html\">America’s Professional Elite: Wealthy, Successful, and Miserable</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cduhigg\">Charles Duhig (@cduhigg)</a>. One part of the article that jumped out at me was a quote from the guy who made $1.2M a year and felt defeated in life said he was locked into a lifestyle that made cutting his pay impossible.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>He had received an offer at a start-up, and he would have loved to take it, but it paid half as much, and he felt locked into a lifestyle that made this pay cut impossible. “My wife laughed when I told her about it,” he said.</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That right there is the true problem of what we all feel when we have moved out of the Poor category (i.e., basic needs being taken care of), we get locked into a new version of ourselves that moving backward would feel like we failed. So our new version of poor keeps increasing with us. I am guessing most people could probably take a different job and still not be <strong><u>poor</u></strong> assuming they could get their spending and priorities in order of what is important. That is work that not everyone is willing to take and it is also something that does not change overnight. Not many people want to downsize their house or give up that yearly trip to Disney with the kids.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Over the past years, I have read a lot of articles from Personal Finance and Minimalist bloggers and the thing that always sticks out to me is the underlying topic of living true to your priorities. Some of that is figuring out what your “basic needs” or “minimum needs” are so then you can really figure out if changes can be made in your job/career to help you really tackle Life Problems that we all face. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>My thoughts / Take Aways</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I am not immune to this thing and it is something I always struggle with as I am sure most people do. My basic needs have been met so at the simplest form I really shouldn’t have any Money Problems. Moving past that, I boil it down to the two resources I have at my disposal in order to make my Life Problems either manageable or fixed. <strong>Time and Money</strong><br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Time and money are both resources at our disposal which is really all that is needed for most problems in our lives and possibly the world. The hard part is to figure out how to balance both of them in order to get an optimal outcome for yourself. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Note I said optimal outcome, as there is not always a perfect balance of having tons of money and tons of free time.</em><br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Each of these resources is needed for prioritizing things that are important to us. For example, if you continue to upgrade your lifestyle by buying the newest gadgets, bigger houses, and fancier cars because you feel it is the most important thing to do you might find yourself in a situation of having no way out. Similar to the guy in the story from the NY Times. All of your resources are being used to tackle a lifestyle you want to achieve and I am guessing that lifestyle gives you less time and money to find love, meaning, and happiness.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

This is further expanding on the topic I discussed a while back titled <a href=\"https://stillthinking.me/media-consumption/\">Media Consumption</a>. I have listened to some great Podcasts and read some great articles. Some of them have great nuggets of information that I write to myself thinking I will expand on it soon. The problem is that I never have time to execute that idea. I just end up with pages of notes that I will never look back at because I am already consuming the next block of information.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n\n<p><h3>The Neverending stream of Information</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p><p>As you can see from the picture below I have a podcast listening problem bigtime. Don’t get me wrong I like all of them but there is never enough time. Mostly I listen to podcasts while running.

I typically don’t “read” books as often as I am listening to books but I still do find time to just sit and read books from time to time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>What types of Media do you Consume</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All of this other media consumption that I would typically say is better than watching hours of TV or spending hours browsing social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) I am now wondering if it should be cut back on as well. I have realized that I sometimes get so consumed in them that before I know it I have accomplished nothing else on my long list of things I would like to accomplish like writing (on this blog is a good point), creating something new, running (yes I am weird like that), or even calling a friend.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Everyone is always saying we spend so much time on Social Media and watching TV shows or movies online. However, how much time do we spend consuming other media, and is that starting to move towards an area of concern? I could easily make the argument that it is better than other things but it also is taking away from me doing something else I enjoy. I don’t have a good answer on that one but since it has crossed my mind I am definitely going to look closer and possibly keep track of how much time in a given week I spend on these other forms of information consumption.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Now it is your turn, do you think you over consume other types of media?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>In full disclosure, this post has been written since April and I keep coming back to it as I am not sure if I was ready to hit publish.

In fact, as of today, we have 450 people registered on the site. That is up 67 from last year where we had 383 users on the site. Maybe when we hit 500 we should have an online party :)! Now only because I am a numbers guru I want to show you the stats of the last two years by month. As you can see it is trending down and in about August last year it started declining faster.

If you have looked at the site a couple of times in the last months it is mostly the same handful of people posting over and over. Not that there is nothing wrong with that as I am glad people are using it as established and it seems like there is another handful of users that look at the site on a daily basis. However, I still find it troubling that there is less engagement on the site than I hoped there would have been. Though for that problem of engagement, I hold myself accountable for a good portion of the blame as I know that there need to be more “things” (e.g., prompts, events, topic discussions) or things to get people engaged in the site. In fact, over the past year, I slowly had forgotten to keep up with the Like, Follow, Share Monday prompts. I think that generated good engagement for readers and hopefully gave some bloggers a nice bump in stats are people were going to check out their site.</p>\n\n<p>On the positive side of things, I was happy to finally finish the <a href=\"https://bloggingmeetup.com/memberposts/\">Members post page</a> which is really just an RSS feed from all members sites. However, on the flip side, I am not sure if people have found it useful or worthwhile. Some of that is I am not able to get any stats from it so unsure if links are being clicked on or not.\n<h4><b>Next Steps</b></h4>\nSo that brings me to today where I have been neglecting this site and trying to figure out what to do next. I would love to get feedback from anyone on what they think should be done with this site. Nothing is a bad idea as I still think a Blogging Community makes sense but maybe this implementation/version of it isn’t working anymore. Maybe the site needs to be more like a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/\">BuddyPress</a> that can be more conversational, or forum-based like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-discussion-board/\">Discussion Board</a>, or maybe even just a big <a href=\"https://slack.com/\">Slack</a> group.</p>\n\n<p>In the short term, however, I am going to figure out a way to kick off the like follow share again but maybe I will try to incorporate it with the RSS feeds from members&rsquo; sites in order to get people looking at something that is newly posted. Over the next several months I am going to really take a hard look at the Blogging Meetup and see where this site should be taken. I am going to hope for feedback from the community as I don’t want to just make this decision alone.\n<h4>Summary</h4>\nYear two was still a good year for the Blogging Meetup as people were still using the site as it was originally intended.

				"content_html": "<p>A little over a week ago we had to make another tough decision in our house as our last dog Princess Jezzabella the Diva of Pink aka PJ was put down. It was honestly like deja vu all over again as my wife and I have talked about it since the passing of <a href=\"https://stillthinking.me/tucker-buddy/\">Tucker</a> a year and a half ago. We honestly never thought PJ was going to survive without him but she proved us wrong. In fact, I feel like she changed her normal behavior of a dog who kept to herself into one wanting more attention and love from us than ever before.</p>\n\n<p>PJ had been with us for 13 years, with another birthday knocking on the door this June 21st. She was the second of our &ldquo;kids&rdquo;, and she has lived in Michigan (where we got her from), Illinois and Minnesota. It was a really tough decision to make, one that we thought two years ago would have been easier than it really was. However, with the different version of PJ over the last couple of years becoming closer with our kids and the fact that we would then soon be a household with no pets for the first time in the last 15 years.</p>\n\n<p>In these final weeks she was throwing up almost daily and her breathing was sounding labored. This was on top of her eyesight fading as well as her hearing is going as well. So she would often bark at us and get scared as people would move around the house or come near her. Not that we will ever know how much pain she was in but we could tell she was not enjoying life as she knew it anymore.</p>\n\n<p>We believe our decision was right as we saw her health declining we didn&rsquo;t want her to suffer from day to day. Also, selfishly we didn&rsquo;t want her last days to be ones where we would be angry that she was throwing up all over and barking at us constantly.</p>\n\n<p>As with our first dog, we wanted to be with her until the end and in our minds, that was again non-negotiable. We ended up using the same place that comes out to your house and performs the procedure with you being able to be right next to them.\n<h4>Final Day</h4>\nWe all tried to spend as much time with PJ as we could on the final day. I took her for a walk in the morning which I normally never do. Since it was a Sunday, we didn’t have as many commitments during the afternoon, so we were able to spend more time with her but since the weather was cold out we were unable to just be outside most of the day. However, while grocery shopping in the morning, my youngest and I decided to pick up some Frosty Paws <i>(Dog Ice Cream if you don’t know)</i> as well as a stuffed toy to let her play within the afternoon. When we got home and my daughter gave her the stuffed toy and PJ just sniffed it right away but it didn&rsquo;t really phase her too much. So I walked over to the toy, picked it up and gave it a squeeze, to which the toy made a squeaking sound and then I tossed it. Instantly, PJ seemed young again as she attacked the toy. She instantly grabbed hold of it and started shaking it violently and tossing it around and then jumping on it again. You see for some reason PJ has always had this thing about stuffed animals with squeakers in it. She is so persistent about disabling the squeaker that she will shred the toy and remove all stuffing just to find the squeaker and destroy it. Once she accomplishes this, she will not really play with the toy again. We had fun watching her play with the new toy and eventually moved on to the Frosty Paws that she really enjoys. After that, it was getting late in the afternoon and I figured since I couldn’t take an evening walk with her that now was probably the best time. It felt so strange walking down the same path we had so many times over the last year and a half, knowing it would be the last time. It is not that I will never walk on that path as it leads to a Lending Library by our house, but I knew I would be walking with more purpose other times as I wouldn’t have a dog to take on this walk after today.</p>\n\n<p>Finally around 5:20 we got the knock on the door and we knew that our time was finally up. It was a little harder this time as we knew what was going to happen and who knows PJ probably knew as well. I am glad that we could be with her the entire time as I still think it would be just as hard dropping her off someplace and then turning around and walking the other way.</p>\n\n<p>PJ, you truly were an amazing dog and I will miss you dearly. You never were the super cuddle bunny that Tucker was but you stepped up and filled that void in a time we needed it most. In fact, maybe it was always in your nature but you just let Tucker fill that role as you liked to be the ferocious protector. Thanks again for the times you were there for me and making my life a little bit better/more exciting. You will always be remembered.</p>\n\n<p>[gallery type=&ldquo;rectangular&rdquo; ids=&ldquo;51122500,51122502,51120912,51122505,51122503,51122501,51122510,51122499,51122504,51121571,51122511,51122512,51122509,51122508,51122507,51122506,51122498,51122513,51122495,51122514&rdquo;]</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Once she accomplishes this, she will not really play with the toy again. We had fun watching her play with the new toy and eventually moved on to the Frosty Paws that she really enjoys. After that, it was getting late in the afternoon and I figured since I couldn’t take an evening walk with her that now was probably the best time. It felt so strange walking down the same path we had so many times over the last year and a half, knowing it would be the last time. It is not that I will never walk on that path as it leads to a Lending Library by our house, but I knew I would be walking with more purpose other times as I wouldn’t have a dog to take on this walk after today.\n\nFinally around 5:20 we got the knock on the door and we knew that our time was finally up. It was a little harder this time as we knew what was going to happen and who knows PJ probably knew as well. I am glad that we could be with her the entire time as I still think it would be just as hard dropping her off someplace and then turning around and walking the other way.\n\nPJ, you truly were an amazing dog and I will miss you dearly. You never were the super cuddle bunny that Tucker was but you stepped up and filled that void in a time we needed it most. In fact, maybe it was always in your nature but you just let Tucker fill that role as you liked to be the ferocious protector. Thanks again for the times you were there for me and making my life a little bit better/more exciting. You will always be remembered.\n\n[gallery type=\"rectangular\" ids=\"51122500,51122502,51120912,51122505,51122503,51122501,51122510,51122499,51122504,51121571,51122511,51122512,51122509,51122508,51122507,51122506,51122498,51122513,51122495,51122514\"]\n\n&nbsp;\n",

It was in my early time using Twitter and started following people and companies in the Twin Cities. One day I finally realized that a couple guys and a company I was following, kept talking about this event as the weather was getting colder. As it turns out the company was SportsNgin (now called <a href=\"https://SportsEngine.com\">SportsEngine</a>), who was the major sponsor of the event and the guys who kept talking about it worked there and as luck would have it we&rsquo;re the co-founders of the company (Justin and Carson). I decided to do some reading about the event and found out it was a big deal and that it was happening in January. To top it off, they were looking for volunteers and I figured what better way to spend a day off work than being outside.</p>\n\n<p><i>So you decided to take a day off work and volunteer to stand on the ice for 8 hours in what could be really cold January weather?</i></p>\n\n<p>Fair question, this probably piqued my interest more as I had just acquired the used materials for a <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2014/11/12/the-season-is.html/\">backyard rink</a> and was in the process of getting it ready for the cold. So as I was hearing about and seeing all of these pictures online of skating in the middle of a lake on an actual pond, I now wanted to see this event in person and watch some games.</p>\n\n<p><em>Quick side story, I grew up in Iowa and have never played hockey in my life or really ice-skated in any prolonged amount of time. I used to rollerblade and play roller hockey in the street but nothing on the ice.</em></p>\n\n<p><h4>Side benefits of volunteering</h4>\nFor what started out to be a random event that I volunteered at, actually ended up being a place I meet a lot of interesting people. Some of these people were ones that I had interacted with on social media before and now that we were meeting face to face it was like we knew each other already. Also, the tournament brings in a bunch of people from all around the state of Minnesota, across the US, and even a couple countries, so it was always fun chatting with people to figure out where they came from and their background stories of playing hockey. That is one of the side benefits of volunteering in an area outside of your “normal” zone, you get to meet people you probably wouldn&rsquo;t have in your life. Every year since then I have enjoyed volunteering at the USPHC like the first. I continue to meet amazing people as well as keep in touch with some from previous years. Also, I get to spend a morning being outside on a big sheet of ice enjoying what nature has to offer (warm or cold). Through the years lots of efficiencies have been made in the Tournament operations as they have really upped their game, but at the core, it has stayed true to its roots of just getting people to play hockey outside as intended.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/f57849a3c5.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><h4>Next year&hellip;</h4>\nWhen you start to think about it 5 years is a long time to do anything in my opinion. Even though I couldn&rsquo;t help out this year, I hope to make it to Nakomis and watch a couple of games. It really is an exciting event to watch in person and I haven&rsquo;t experienced anything quite like it.</p>\n\n<p>If you have made it this far and want to see what it looks like check out the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL6zifIbpfnZph47xgohFWQ\">US Pond Hockey Championships YouTube channel</a> as they have some amazing videos from 2016 and 2017.

Each time I made it longer and sometimes faster until eventually it was just a habit and I was feeling healthier and had a good routine. When the month was up I realized I had already run a 5k and running another one wasn't going to be an issue.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><i><b>Some final thoughts…</b></i></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Reading a book like this helps give you motivation and encouragement as you reflect on yourself.

				"title": "Using House Projects to help Declutter your Life",
				"content_html": "<p>In our journey of living a more intentional life by decluttering our belongings and owning less. We have recently found out that house projects have helped us make larger strides in this overall journey.</p>\n\n<p>Owning an older house provides you with lots of fun opportunities to work on <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2012/03/15/master-bathroom-remodel.html\">projects</a> that might include: updating rooms by painting or carpeting; discovering issues or fixing leaks that need a professional or home handyman; or even just finding a room that needs a full remodel like an outdated kitchen.</p>\n\n<p>My wife and I have done all of the above over the last 9 years we have lived in our house. The worst part of any housing project is that you have to move all of your belongings from the area the project is taking place to another area. For most of our house projects up till a couple years ago, we would move everything from one place to another and then move it ALL back once we were done.</p>\n\n<p>However, in the past couple of years, my wife and I have realized that we need to use those disruptions in our normal space and be very mindful of what we put back once it is all done. In looking back, we have probably moved every piece of furniture, toys, books, boxes, pictures, or other items from one room to another as kids changed rooms and home projects happened. It would have made too much sense during those moves to time to take the extra couple of minutes to set things aside and only slowly add back what is truly needed.</p>\n\n<p>It probably wasn't until this latest project of our Kitchen remodel that we really took hold of this idea. We moved everything out of our Kitchen, Dining Room, and Living room as we had the wall separating all of those removed. It was a messy process that allows our family of 5 to get really cozy in the basement that only has 2 bedrooms.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the process by which we packed everything away but the couple single sets of kitchen stuff we needed follows that of what Ryan from <a href=\"https://www.theminimalists.com/packing/\">The Minimalists</a> described as a <b>packing party</b>. However, I am always under the mindset that you don’t really need a term or reason, you just need to figure out what works well for you. We are still on this long journey of slowly decluttering room by room and figuring out what makes sense for our family of 5 as we cannot take on too much at once or it would be utter chaos in our life.</p>\n\n<p>Once our kitchen was finished and it was time to move everything back in we only moved in things we needed and made sure it had a purpose. For the kitchen, this was really easy as everything was in boxes we only brought stuff out that we used for cooking on a daily or weekly basis. A couple things we noticed during this process were:</p>\n\n<ul><li><b>Coffee Cups (or drinkware)</b> - I love coffee but really who needs to have around 30 coffee cups. I am not sure who we were planning on inviting over for coffee or hot chocolate but we realized that was way too many.</li><li><b>Tupperware</b> - How can we have so much of this and nothing matches. Where did all the lids to the small-sized containers go and why am I stuck with so many large lids with no containers. Let's just say we didn’t keep a lot and have paired this down so we can always find a lid and dish.</li><li><b>Cooking Utensils </b>- Don’t get me wrong it is always great to have a spare but I am not sure we needed 10 spatulas. It was more than likely we only needed 2-3 as we used the same one most of the time.</li><li><b>Mismatched stuff </b>- During our cleaning out we found lots of plates, cups, and other items that were not a full set even though we had one full nice set already.

				"content_text": "<p>In our journey of living a more intentional life by decluttering our belongings and owning less. We have recently found out that house projects have helped us make larger strides in this overall journey.</p>\n\n<p>Owning an older house provides you with lots of fun opportunities to work on <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2012/03/15/master-bathroom-remodel.html\">projects</a> that might include: updating rooms by painting or carpeting; discovering issues or fixing leaks that need a professional or home handyman; or even just finding a room that needs a full remodel like an outdated kitchen.</p>\n\n<p>My wife and I have done all of the above over the last 9 years we have lived in our house. The worst part of any housing project is that you have to move all of your belongings from the area the project is taking place to another area. For most of our house projects up till a couple years ago, we would move everything from one place to another and then move it ALL back once we were done.</p>\n\n<p>However, in the past couple of years, my wife and I have realized that we need to use those disruptions in our normal space and be very mindful of what we put back once it is all done. In looking back, we have probably moved every piece of furniture, toys, books, boxes, pictures, or other items from one room to another as kids changed rooms and home projects happened. It would have made too much sense during those moves to time to take the extra couple of minutes to set things aside and only slowly add back what is truly needed.</p>\n\n<p>It probably wasn't until this latest project of our Kitchen remodel that we really took hold of this idea. We moved everything out of our Kitchen, Dining Room, and Living room as we had the wall separating all of those removed. It was a messy process that allows our family of 5 to get really cozy in the basement that only has 2 bedrooms.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the process by which we packed everything away but the couple single sets of kitchen stuff we needed follows that of what Ryan from <a href=\"https://www.theminimalists.com/packing/\">The Minimalists</a> described as a <b>packing party</b>. However, I am always under the mindset that you don’t really need a term or reason, you just need to figure out what works well for you. We are still on this long journey of slowly decluttering room by room and figuring out what makes sense for our family of 5 as we cannot take on too much at once or it would be utter chaos in our life.</p>\n\n<p>Once our kitchen was finished and it was time to move everything back in we only moved in things we needed and made sure it had a purpose. For the kitchen, this was really easy as everything was in boxes we only brought stuff out that we used for cooking on a daily or weekly basis. A couple things we noticed during this process were:</p>\n\n<ul><li><b>Coffee Cups (or drinkware)</b> - I love coffee but really who needs to have around 30 coffee cups. I am not sure who we were planning on inviting over for coffee or hot chocolate but we realized that was way too many.</li><li><b>Tupperware</b> - How can we have so much of this and nothing matches. Where did all the lids to the small-sized containers go and why am I stuck with so many large lids with no containers. Let's just say we didn’t keep a lot and have paired this down so we can always find a lid and dish.</li><li><b>Cooking Utensils </b>- Don’t get me wrong it is always great to have a spare but I am not sure we needed 10 spatulas. It was more than likely we only needed 2-3 as we used the same one most of the time.</li><li><b>Mismatched stuff </b>- During our cleaning out we found lots of plates, cups, and other items that were not a full set even though we had one full nice set already. These were perfect candidates to not work back into the cycle as one cup isn’t as good as a nice set of 12.</li></ul>\n\n<p>There were lots of other examples of that were we just had lots or multiples of items that we didn’t need to continue to keep around cluttering up shelves or drawers.</p>\n\n<p>In the living and dining rooms, our goal was to remove excess furniture and things on the wall to get a more minimalistic look.

While I can’t say I have really severed ties with anything yet it has been on my mind as 2017 started and I have put a plan in place to evaluate those various activities as I want to make sure I am getting the most out of my days and making sure I am spending it where I want to spend it (more on this in a future post).

around but still enjoyed wandering around and checking out the things to jump on.  After the dog park, we went back home and I just laid on the couch with Tucker for probably 2 hours.  Honestly, I am not even sure the last time I just sat in one place for two hours and did nothing.  Then we ate dinner and I figured it was time to take him for another walk or his last walk with the whole family.  Once we got back from our walk all the kids sat with Tucker and were reading him books while he laid next to them.  Finally, around 7pm we got the knock on the door and knew it was time.</p>\n\n<p>Tucker, you truly were an amazing dog and I will miss you dearly.  Thank you for all the times you were there for me and for making my life a little bit better/more exciting.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/0200175130.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" />\n<em>Tucker at just 10 weeks old</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/f605db9f34.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" />\n<em>Tucker with his new puppy sister (2005)</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/ca1f4a38c9.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" />\n<em>Tucker loved to play fetch</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/927800795b.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" />\n<em>Tucker on his 1st Birthday</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/01d847faaf.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" />\n<em>Tucker loved to play fetch</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/d7cc1dc756.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\n<em>Tucker loved to play ball and catch it in the air</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/9d8bf74793.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"899\" alt=\"\" />\n<em>Perfect picture as Tucker always liked to lick</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/a08de642cf.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" />\n<em>Tucker was gentle with all our kids while they climbed over him growing up</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/8a34232e55.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\n<em>Tucker looking good after a haircut</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/76015de6d3.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" />\n<em>Tucker always liked to lay in things not necessary meant for him</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/65f2f92546.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" alt=\"\" />\n<em>Tucker sitting on the top of the couch looking out into the backyard</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/a525dc8357.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" alt=\"\" />\n<em>Tucker king of the hill at the Dog Park one last time</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/2c56d018af.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\" />\n<em>Early Morning walk just me and Tucker</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/d81027cb7e.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" />\n<em>Last walk as a Family hours before</em></p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Neon-Fever-Dream-Eliot-Peper-ebook/dp/B01HUCXBTM/?tag=stthink-20\">Neon Fever Dream</a> by Eliot Peper (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/eliotpeper\">@EliotPeper</a>) was a really good page turner that once I finally started I couldn&rsquo;t put it down as I wanted to know what would happen next (<em>I probably should have read about one month ago but kept putting it off until Monday night</em>).  This is another book of his that I can&rsquo;t recommend enough as I have tried to read every one of Eliot&rsquo;s books since he first published Uncommon Stock: Version 1.0 a couple years back.</p>\n\n<p>In full disclosure, I was fortunate enough to receive an advance copy of the book a while back.  However, at this exact time, you can&rsquo;t read it yet but can Pre-Purchase it.  In fact, even though I received the advanced copy I still decided to purchase it as well.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Neon-Fever-Dream-Eliot-Peper-ebook/dp/B01HUCXBTM/?tag=stthink-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/c58df3eba6.jpg\" alt=\"NFD_Book\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The story starts out by getting you acquainted with the characters over the first couple of chapters to give you a good backdrop of the main character so you get a sense of her background.  Then everything is turned upside down in an instant with Asha and as a whim of trying to take control of her own life she ends up heading to Burning Man with her new best &ldquo;friend&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>However, just when everything seemed to be getting on the right track, Asha realized she doesn&rsquo;t know the people she is with as well as she thought and she needs to quickly figure out who to trust and who is telling the truth.  Once sorted out is only the beginning as the bigger story of a criminal take down brings more twists and turns to the past of hers and the people she decided to trust.  Each page will make you question if she is trusting the right people from her current situation or her people from her past from long ago.  Will they still be able to take down the criminal empire?  <em>(Come on I can&rsquo;t tell you the whole story here, check it out yourself, trust me it is worth it.) </em></p>\n\n<p>Most of the story takes place at Burning Man, which I have never been to and not sure I ever will in my lifetime.  However, with Eliot&rsquo;s style of writing, I felt like I was there.  With my little understanding of the event and layout, I really did feel like I was walking or biking around the playa visiting the various places.  In fact, one specific part of the book detailed out the author&rsquo;s thoughts on the event that shows you the amount of detail he added:</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-left:60px;\"><em>This was a city built and dismantled in a week—a collective </em><em>piece of art as beautiful and fleeting as the mandala they had </em><em>watched the monks create with such painstaking care.

				"content_text": "<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Neon-Fever-Dream-Eliot-Peper-ebook/dp/B01HUCXBTM/?tag=stthink-20\">Neon Fever Dream</a> by Eliot Peper (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/eliotpeper\">@EliotPeper</a>) was a really good page turner that once I finally started I couldn't put it down as I wanted to know what would happen next (<em>I probably should have read about one month ago but kept putting it off until Monday night</em>).  This is another book of his that I can't recommend enough as I have tried to read every one of Eliot's books since he first published Uncommon Stock: Version 1.0 a couple years back.\n\nIn full disclosure, I was fortunate enough to receive an advance copy of the book a while back.  However, at this exact time, you can't read it yet but can Pre-Purchase it.  In fact, even though I received the advanced copy I still decided to purchase it as well.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Neon-Fever-Dream-Eliot-Peper-ebook/dp/B01HUCXBTM/?tag=stthink-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/c58df3eba6.jpg\" alt=\"NFD_Book\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\" /></a>\n\nThe story starts out by getting you acquainted with the characters over the first couple of chapters to give you a good backdrop of the main character so you get a sense of her background.  Then everything is turned upside down in an instant with Asha and as a whim of trying to take control of her own life she ends up heading to Burning Man with her new best \"friend\".\n\nHowever, just when everything seemed to be getting on the right track, Asha realized she doesn't know the people she is with as well as she thought and she needs to quickly figure out who to trust and who is telling the truth.  Once sorted out is only the beginning as the bigger story of a criminal take down brings more twists and turns to the past of hers and the people she decided to trust.  Each page will make you question if she is trusting the right people from her current situation or her people from her past from long ago.  Will they still be able to take down the criminal empire?  <em>(Come on I can't tell you the whole story here, check it out yourself, trust me it is worth it.) </em>\n\nMost of the story takes place at Burning Man, which I have never been to and not sure I ever will in my lifetime.  However, with Eliot's style of writing, I felt like I was there.  With my little understanding of the event and layout, I really did feel like I was walking or biking around the playa visiting the various places.  In fact, one specific part of the book detailed out the author's thoughts on the event that shows you the amount of detail he added:\n\n<p style=\"padding-left:60px;\"><em>This was a city built and dismantled in a week—a collective </em><em>piece of art as beautiful and fleeting as the mandala they had </em><em>watched the monks create with such painstaking care. Calling </em><em>it a festival was a slight. It was more than that. It was an experiment, </em><em>an exploration of what it meant to be alive.</em></p>\n\nOne of my favorite quotes of the book that kept on popping up (four times I think) was:\n<blockquote> You cannot control the world, but only you control how you react to it.</blockquote>\n<p>\nFinally, if you are a fan of Eliot's other writing you might find the \"easter egg\" in the book where a past character might have made an appearance.  I wish I could say I would have realized it all on my own but prior to reading the book I had read the book review by <a href=\"http://www.feld.com/archives/2016/05/book-neon-fever-rising.html\">Brad Feld</a> (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/bfeld\">@bfeld</a>) and already knew it was coming so was on the look out of for it.\n\n<em><strong>Update:  </strong></em>If you are looking for some details on what inspired the author to write this book check out his post title <a href=\"https://medium.com/the-mission/a-dark-secret-hides-in-the-swirling-dust-and-exultant-revelry-of-burning-man-ffcdfca70ee9#.zf5bkvp00\" target=\"_blank\">A dark secret hides in the swirling dust and exultant revelry of Burning Man</a>, where he talks about it.  I always think it is interesting to hear how/why an author wrote a particular book.\n",

Is success about making the most money? No, money for the most part turns people into jerks.&rdquo; - Chris Sacca</blockquote>\nThere is so many good words of wisdom in the video that I wish I could have heard that exact advice when I was leaving school.  However, fast forward to today and I think the advice is still valid and the points that he is talking about are applicable no matter where you are in your life.\n<blockquote>&ldquo;It all comes down to Happiness.  Happy people get jobs, happy people create, happy people win, happy people fall in love and raise family&rsquo;s, they lead and change the world. Happy people get what they want because often happy people realize they don&rsquo;t actually need much more than what they have and appreciate what they got.  Happy people are contagious.&rdquo; - Chris Sacca</blockquote>\nI would really suggest you watch the whole video as there are a lot of good quotes and thought-provoking topics he touches on.  Four of the points stuck out to me as they are still so applicable today with everything happening in the world and how technology is continuing to change the way we do things and interact with people.  In the simplest form his words of advice and ultimately a way to be successful is <em><strong>Be Present, Be Helpful, Be Ethical and Be your Weird Self</strong></em>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/RskzYHPlh5U\">youtu.be/RskzYHPlh&hellip;</a></p>\n\n<p>via <a href=\"http://apps.npr.org/commencement/speech/chris-sacca-university-of-minnesota-2011/\">Chris Sacca at University of Minnesota, 2011 : The Best Commencement Speeches, Ever : NPR</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Another one of my favorite quotes from the video was that around GPA as I also share the same view-point as him.  Hope you enjoyed the video.\n<blockquote>&ldquo;Your GPA only matters to people who have no other reason to find you interesting.&rdquo; - Chris Sacca</blockquote></p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Now in the second week of March (playing catch up), I thought I would give a quick list of some Podcasts (and favorite episodes) that have been keeping me company while running in the evenings.  My favorite part about all of them is that you can subscribe to them in iTunes, which makes it super easy to pull the next one up when you are heading out on a run or long car trip.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://thisweekinstartups.com/\">This Week in Startups</a> by Jason Calacanis (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jason\">@jason</a>) - The show is done twice per week where the host Jason has various entrepreneurs on talking about their companies, what they do, and how it could change the world.  Also, every couple of weeks there is a news roundtable where he has two guests on that talk about some of the big tech topics out there.  In January, one of my favorite shows to listen to was <a href=\"http://thisweekinstartups.com/emily-kirsch-powerhouse/\">E614 where Jason was talking to the CEO Emily Kirsch</a> who Co-Founded <a href=\"https://powerhouse.solar/\">PowerHouse</a>.  The conversation was very interesting as it touched on what some new companies are doing along the lines of Solar and how Solar is becoming cheaper and one of the major roadblocks they run into is Policy.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/\">The Tim Ferris Show</a> by Tim Ferriss (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/tferriss\">@tferriss</a>) - This is a great podcast and Tim has some really great guests like Edward Norton, Chris Sacca, Shaun White, Naval Ravikant, and Seth Godin.  Note all of those were just in the month of January and February.  Each of those people was probably my favorite episode of the last two months and I won&rsquo;t dive into it too much as I wrote a little bit about Naval Ravikant&rsquo;s interview in a <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/02/19/power-of-the.html\">prior post</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.intentionallywandering.com/\">Intentionally Wandering</a> by Jeff Sandquist (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeff_wandering/\">@jeff_wandering</a>) - This one was created by a local Minnesota guy named Jeff Sandquist.  I really like how the podcasts are normally only 20-30 min which is perfect to listen to the whole thing in one sitting (or run as I prefer).  The other neat thing about this podcast is that it revolves around this same theme of Intentionally Wandering and, in my opinion, sharpening your own focus on how you view your world and the world around you.  He brings in some very interesting guests as who also do a great job of making you think and sharing their experiences.  In fact, I really like how he ends the episodes with guests the same way by asking them the same question that I always try to answer myself after each one.\n<blockquote>&ldquo;What is your why?  Why do you do what you do?&rdquo;</blockquote>\nI should probably start writing my own answer down to see how much it changes over time.  Another nice thing, since I am normally out running when listening to podcasts, is how Jeff puts show notes on the websites about the episodes with links to find the other materials (books/articles) that were mentioned in the show.  One of my favorite recent episodes is a solo episode he did titled &ldquo; Lessons Learned from Being Curious</a>&rdquo; and there was a quote in there that really stuck out to me as I can see myself in this quote sometimes.\n<blockquote>“We are all born curious, but not all of us remain curious. Curiosity, while it does come naturally to all of us, it can easily be suppressed, lost and destroyed, depending on our environment, our upbringing, our experiences, and even our thoughts and our reactions and emotions towards this idea of curiosity.” - Jeff Sandquist</blockquote>\nSo what are you waiting for go check out some of these podcasts today!  Also, do you have any that you listen to frequently?  Let me know in the comments.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n",

Then to top that off it is about this Startup company trying to catch people involved in financial fraud, murder, and deception.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Now I could probably write on and on about what happened but that would just ruin the fun of reading it.  So I will at least give you a couple of my favorite quotes/sayings from the book that stuck out to me.  I think each of these just go to show the amount of information beyond being a good story is packed into this book and more specifically this series.</div>\n<div></div>\n<blockquote>\n<div>The short version is that when you lay good code on top of bad code, the result is still bad code.</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<div>You can&rsquo;t wait until you had enough time for exercise. You had to make time for it no matter what.</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<div>Economics, the science of explaining tomorrow why the predictions you made yesterday didn&rsquo;t come true today.</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<div>There is something ephemeral but infinitely satisfying about starting something yourself.  Your shit is on the line and you and your team are where the buck stops.  If you get a kick out of that, then you end up having few other employment choices.  If you&rsquo;ve got that bug, you essentially have to start a company or get involved with startups.  Otherwise, your brain starts to rot and you get all bitchy and miserable.</div></blockquote>\nFinally, at the end of the book after it is all done (don&rsquo;t worry I am not going to spoil the ending) but Eliot Peper hinted at coming out with a new book (not part of this series) in Spring of 2016.  So if you are like me and enjoy his style of writing you probably should following him on twitter (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/@EliotPeper\">@EliotPeper</a>) and subscribe to his newsletter from his website (<a href=\"http://www.eliotpeper.com/\">http://www.eliotpeper.com/</a>).</p>\n",

You had to make time for it no matter what.</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<div>Economics, the science of explaining tomorrow why the predictions you made yesterday didn't come true today.</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<div>There is something ephemeral but infinitely satisfying about starting something yourself.  Your shit is on the line and you and your team are where the buck stops.  If you get a kick out of that, then you end up having few other employment choices.  If you've got that bug, you essentially have to start a company or get involved with startups.  Otherwise, your brain starts to rot and you get all bitchy and miserable.</div></blockquote>\nFinally, at the end of the book after it is all done (don't worry I am not going to spoil the ending) but Eliot Peper hinted at coming out with a new book (not part of this series) in Spring of 2016.  So if you are like me and enjoy his style of writing you probably should following him on twitter (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/@EliotPeper\">@EliotPeper</a>) and subscribe to his newsletter from his website (<a href=\"http://www.eliotpeper.com/\">http://www.eliotpeper.com/</a>).\n",
