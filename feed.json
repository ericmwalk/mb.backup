Here are a couple: [Veil](https://ericmwalk.blog/2020/05/28/veil-by-eliot.html), [True Blue (A Short Story)](https://ericmwalk.blog/2017/06/23/true-blue-a.html), [Bandwidth](https://ericmwalk.blog/2018/04/01/bandwidth-by-eliot.html), [Borderless](https://ericmwalk.blog/2020/05/28/veil-by-eliot.html), and [Breach](https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/05/breach-by-eliot-peper.html). Also, check out his website as he has a great [newsletter](https://eliotpeper.com).*\n\n",

				"title": "Getting Organized 🗃",
				"content_html": "<p>I am not completely there yet but it seems a lot of my other projects as of lately have revolved around this idea of organizing things&hellip;</p>\n<p>This probably started back in early January when I went down the rabbit hole of getting all my old DVDs on a computer to use with Plex as a way to free up some shelf space in the basement. I don’t remember the last time we have used any of those DVDs except a very small handful we take along in the RV. However, since putting them all on the computer, I think we have watched 10 movies off there so far. The next step in this process was getting a better handle on our Picture organization too, it aligned nicely with the first project because we had to get more HD space and in that purchase, we got a <em>new</em> computer so everything needed to be transferred from the old drive. With the new computer, the nice advantage is I have been able to remotely log into it and it is fast enough that I could look through old stuff and organize other things to fit with the process we use now.

				"content_text": "I am not completely there yet but it seems a lot of my other projects as of lately have revolved around this idea of organizing things...\n\nThis probably started back in early January when I went down the rabbit hole of getting all my old DVDs on a computer to use with Plex as a way to free up some shelf space in the basement. I don’t remember the last time we have used any of those DVDs except a very small handful we take along in the RV. However, since putting them all on the computer, I think we have watched 10 movies off there so far. The next step in this process was getting a better handle on our Picture organization too, it aligned nicely with the first project because we had to get more HD space and in that purchase, we got a *new* computer so everything needed to be transferred from the old drive. With the new computer, the nice advantage is I have been able to remotely log into it and it is fast enough that I could look through old stuff and organize other things to fit with the process we use now.

However, there is a lot more clean-up than I anticipated so this will be an ongoing project for a while.

My first thought was to use it as an easier way to access Pictures and Videos I had stored on a central storage device in my house. We store all of our pictures and videos there (which is then backed up to Backblaze) but sometimes getting them back or finding them again is not as easy as it should be. File sharing is slow to display previews and standing in the laundry room to use the computer isn’t ideal either.

I realized that I could just box them up and put them away but some of them I realized I don’t have digitally and now that my kids are getting older I might want to watch with them. Unfortunately, before I started to box any of these up my wife reminded me that we do use the DVDs sometimes when we go Camping since streaming is not an option. Sometimes it is nice to have some on hand as a backup when it rains. Hoping there was a way to figure this all out I was reminded of an article from fellow Micro.blog friend Jason Burk describing how he created the <a href=\"https://burk.io/2021/creating-the-golden-set\">Golden Set</a> by converting his DVDs to MP4s. <strong>BINGO</strong> now I had a project. *Current status is after a couple trial and errors, I have done about 150 of our DVDs and I feel like I have a long way to go.</li>\n<li><strong>DVDs</strong> (Part 2) - Due to some of the trial and errors of the first project I dug out an old computer I had gotten long ago. Come to find out it would be the perfect DVD machine but I realized that it did not have windows on it and that sent me down a path of digging through old CDs to find some sort of Windows CDs from past systems. I did find an old copy of Windows 8 which was working fine until I couldn’t seem to get any updates to fix the mouse drivers and whatnot. The solution was going to be to buy Windows 10 (which I wasn’t excited about) but I found out I was eligible for a free Windows 10 upgrade. That all worked well but it took some time to get to that point.</li>\n<li><strong>Storage</strong> 🤦‍♂️&hellip; As you work through the above projects you can only guess this leads to the question of do you have enough storage for all of these DVDs that you are going to now make digital? The answer is NO.. No, I do not.

To me, that is too close. <em>I need to still figure this out in the meantime I had a 2TB removable drive that I am currently putting all the movies on after I pull them off the DVDs.

				"content_html": "<p>Two weeks ago I decided to set off on completing a <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/01/xx-running-challenge.html\">4x4x40</a> as part of some crazy ideas for my 40th birthday year. However, after I reached the 40 miles I felt like I really needed to continue as I figured at that point I might never do this again and get so close to hitting the real number and completing a 4x4x48 (run 4 miles every 4 hours for 48 hours). Maybe it helped that I was a bit sleep deprived at the time and not thinking clearly as I figured what was two more 4 mile runs at that point.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/d0d7eda4b0.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Since I posted after each of my runs with a short photo, time, and thought I will not rehash all of them. I don’t want to make light of this challenge as I think it was hard but the miles themselves weren’t the worst for me. Some of that could have been that I didn’t really have a pace per mile in mind. I obviously wasn’t going to try to run the fastest 4 miles I could every time. However, in my mind, I wanted to keep all of my averages per run under 9 min/miles. The biggest struggle for me during this challenge was trying to fit it in during a normal working day. Due to the weather forecast and maybe my last-minute planning, as it was December, I did it during the middle of a workweek. So I scheduled it out earlier in the week and pretty much created an appointment for myself every 4 hrs. It worked great the first day but the second day some things came up at work so I had to shrink down one of my 3 hr blocks of <em>recovery</em> and extend other ones. I still was able to get the run in that 4 hr bock but I wasn’t as consistently on the hour as I was the first day of running. In a way, I am wondering if working both days helped me keep my focus away from running and how tired I might have been as I was doing things I needed to do during the day. Then in the evenings I still helped get the kids to activities and stuff.</p>\n<p>Now obviously the lack of sleep is one thing but the worst time of runs for me was the 5am runs that I did. I think it is because after the late-night 1am run it always took me longer than anticipated to fall asleep. You would have thought I would have been tired enough to just get into the house and fall asleep. I am guessing that the kick of adrenaline that was in my body messed with allowing my brain to shut down at that time. So for both days by the time I would will myself to sleep and it would work I think I only got 1 hr before I would have to wake up at 5am to run. After that run, I would just start my day and didn’t try to get any more rest as my youngest gets on the bus at 7am.</p>\n<p>In the end, I have never run so many miles in two days. It ended up being 48.9 miles due to one run when I put my trust in a running friend who lead me astray by an extra mile. Those two days were more mileage than I had completed any week during my marathon training this past year. It was an interesting challenge as it took careful planning as I still worked and helped with kid activities like a normal day. It was just I ran every 4 hrs 😁. The day after I was done I felt pretty wiped out from most likely lack of sleep and over-exercise. Fast forward two weeks later and I am back on track. Maybe I will do another one of these challenges someday but probably no time soon. At least for the rest of this year, it will be back to the normal scheduled running for me.<br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h4 id=\"full-data-of-runs---links-to-posts-and-strava\">Full Data of Runs - Links to Posts and Strava</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/01/running-log-xx.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 1/10 (1:01 am)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6328757476\">4.02 miles at 8:39/mi pace, 36°F 🌧</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/01/183000.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 2/10 (5:02 am)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6329422080\">4.02 miles at 8:55/mi pace, 37°F 🌘🌥</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/01/184500.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 3/10 (9:00 am)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6330251888\">4.01 miles at 8:51/mi pace, 36°F 🌥</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/01/191500.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 4/10 (1:01 pm)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6331221972\">4.02 miles at 8:33/mi pace, 45°F ☁️</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/01/193000.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 5/10 (4:41 pm)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6331966369\">4.02 miles at 8:59/mi pace, 50°F 🌥</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/01/214806.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 6/10 (7:57 pm)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6332480665\">4.01 miles at 8:31/mi pace, 48°F 🌥</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/02/running-log-xx.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 7/10 (1:02 am)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6332890004\">4.02 miles at 8:47/mi pace, 47°F ☁️</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/02/055602.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 8/10 (5:04 am)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6333540689\">4.02 miles at 8:59/mi pace, 40°F 🌌</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/02/113029.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 9/10 (9:52 am)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6334553267\"> 4.02 miles at 8:35/mi pace, 38°F ☀️</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/02/143306.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 10/10 (12:58 pm)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6335309327\">4.69 miles at 8:06/mi pace, 45°F ☁️</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/02/180000.html\">Running Log: 4x4x44 - 11/10 (4:46 pm)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6336063574\">4.03 miles at 8:27/mi pace, 41°F ☁️</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/02/220254.html\">Running Log: 4x4x48 - 12/10 (8:51 pm)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6336606100\">4.03 miles at 8:35/mi pace, 39°F 🌧</a></em></li>\n</ul>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Earlier this year I had a plan to run 40 miles with a really good friend of mine through the mountains of Colorado. We thought it would be fun to run 40 miles since we both turned 40 this year. Not to mention suffering together and probably laughing along the way made it seem like a feat that could be pushed through to accomplishment. The timing was not going to be great for me as it was one month before my <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/10/04/twin-cities-marathon.html\">Twin Cities Marathon</a> but I was game to do it as it sounded amazing. Honestly, I wasn’t even sure how to train for such a thing but I just said yes and he said he would work out the details. The bummer is around May he hurt his ankle and knew the run wouldn’t happen. I was bummed that it fell apart but it probably worked out since I hadn’t run a marathon for 20 years and I wasn’t sure what I was in for. I am sure it probably wouldn’t have been great to come in not feeling the best from a 40 mile run through the mountains no matter how long it took us.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to about 1 month before I ran the marathon and I stumbled across this concept of running 4 miles every 4 hours for 48 hours. At the time I didn’t know anything about it but thought that had a nice ring to it. However, the whole 48 hrs didn’t mesh with my goal so I figured I would modify it slightly to fit as a <strong><em>4x4x40</em></strong> instead 😁.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>4 miles every 4 hours for 40 hours since I am 40 this year</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That leads me up to now&hellip; After the <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/10/04/twin-cities-marathon.html\">marathon</a>, I have been trying to take it easy and just running for pleasure but I feel like I have been missing something as I had hoped to do something else with this <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/03/24/forty.html\">year 40</a>. After pondering this for the last month, I realized that if I am going to do it I need to do it before it gets too cold in the night to complete this task so I am going to start tonight (or today) and we will see how this goes.</p>\n<p>I do know more about the real 4x4x48 challenge and the guy who created it. However, my goal still has not changed. I will probably write about it as I go mostly just to document it along the way so I apologize to anyone not interested in this disregard my posts for at least more than 40 hrs from the first. Then we will be back to our regularly scheduled posting.</p>\n<p>I don’t have any main goals in mind if you are wondering. My goal is probably to do as many of these 4x4s that I can in hopes to get to 40 but that is a lot of mileage for me in a short amount of time. Also, I am not concerned about my pace either except hoping I don’t go too fast at any point as that could screw things up. Either way, this is going to be an interesting experiment no matter how many I get done so we will see how it goes!</p>\n<p>A final note for those interested, I am still working and getting kids to school and activities. So I am kind of treating this as just some breaks throughout my day and that is another reason why this time lined up perfectly. In the perfect world, I would only be doing this 40hrs with no other responsibilities. 🤷‍♂️</p>\n",

I was bummed that it fell apart but it probably worked out since I hadn’t run a marathon for 20 years and I wasn’t sure what I was in for. I am sure it probably wouldn’t have been great to come in not feeling the best from a 40 mile run through the mountains no matter how long it took us.\n\nFast forward to about 1 month before I ran the marathon and I stumbled across this concept of running 4 miles every 4 hours for 48 hours. At the time I didn’t know anything about it but thought that had a nice ring to it. However, the whole 48 hrs didn’t mesh with my goal so I figured I would modify it slightly to fit as a **_4x4x40_** instead 😁. \n\n> 4 miles every 4 hours for 40 hours since I am 40 this year\n\nThat leads me up to now... After the [marathon](https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/10/04/twin-cities-marathon.html), I have been trying to take it easy and just running for pleasure but I feel like I have been missing something as I had hoped to do something else with this [year 40](https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/03/24/forty.html). After pondering this for the last month, I realized that if I am going to do it I need to do it before it gets too cold in the night to complete this task so I am going to start tonight (or today) and we will see how this goes. \n\nI do know more about the real 4x4x48 challenge and the guy who created it. However, my goal still has not changed. I will probably write about it as I go mostly just to document it along the way so I apologize to anyone not interested in this disregard my posts for at least more than 40 hrs from the first. Then we will be back to our regularly scheduled posting. \n\nI don’t have any main goals in mind if you are wondering. My goal is probably to do as many of these 4x4s that I can in hopes to get to 40 but that is a lot of mileage for me in a short amount of time. Also, I am not concerned about my pace either except hoping I don’t go too fast at any point as that could screw things up. Either way, this is going to be an interesting experiment no matter how many I get done so we will see how it goes!\n\nA final note for those interested, I am still working and getting kids to school and activities. So I am kind of treating this as just some breaks throughout my day and that is another reason why this time lined up perfectly. In the perfect world, I would only be doing this 40hrs with no other responsibilities. 🤷‍♂️\n\n",

				"content_text": "Earlier this week where I live a runner, [Mike Elhard](https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-news/eden-prairie-man-found-dead-was-training-for-the-chicago-marathon), who was going out on a 20 mile training run for the Chicago Marathon went missing on Monday morning. He wasn’t running at night or even during really hot weather as it was 10am and the day was actually cooler than normal. Once they realized he was missing the local police and residences searched that late afternoon and into the evening on roads and paths near his house and routes he frequently took. Unfortunately, he was found dead Tuesday just off a sidewalk in some brush. The police said there was no signs of foul play but nothing else has been released.\n\n![](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/c33ec0c365.jpg)\n\nAs I was running yesterday, I couldn’t shake the thought out of my mind as I too am a runner mostly running by myself during the week.

After I got done I was reminded that I have been meaning to reach out to this guy for a long time and every time I would think about it I would find about 100x other things to accomplish. Don't get me wrong it has nothing to do with the other guy because I do this all of the time. It is just one of those tasks that always get buried for me thinking I will find a better time to reach out or I will do it right after work.\n\nI guess you could say it is a good thing I am aware of it 🤷‍♂️. However, I am going to try to be better and see about setting time aside for starters each week to reconnect with some people whom I haven't but have been meaning to for a while. We all get busy from time to time and with kids thrown into the mix it gets even worse. However, there is always time to keep connections flowing instead of dead ends.\n\n\n",

				"content_html": "<p>If you are looking for a great motivational book to keep you going in whatever you are trying to do look no further. If you are looking for a book about how to run then this might not be what you are looking for but you should pick this one up as well to give you some laughs along your running journey.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The great part about this book is that it is all about the Running journey and exploring why people run and the motivation behind it. By using Brendan&rsquo;s and others' relatable running stories it frames up challenges all of us face to just get motivated to do things in life. There are always obstacles in the way, better things to do, or thinking we are too busy to do something. As a &ldquo;runner&rdquo; myself, I can personally relate to the specific stories of running as no matter how much I love running, being outdoors, It is much better to have the run done and behind me as I too am someone that struggles most of the time to just get out the door.  Specific to running, everyone has their own story and reasons why they run and Brendan also explores that as part of the book.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://semi-rad.com/2021/03/people-who-get-to-decide-what-the-point-of-all-your-running-is/\"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>\n<p>Now I am a fan of Brendan Leonard fan of his work from his site <a href=\"https://semi-rad.com\">Semi-Rad</a>, and this book did not disappoint. That being said, I have seen some of these graphs before but the rest of the story and context is short, witty, and perfectly sized for most of us to get through in a timely manor.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite parts of the book is when he is talking about what he calls the &ldquo;invisible work&rdquo; which in the context of the book is all of the miles and hours you put in before a race or event. In fact, for someone like myself who is planning on running a <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/07/08/it-is-official.html\">Marathon</a> later this year, I have already run about 37 marathons with the number of miles I have put in so far.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Inspiration is for amateurs. The rest of us just show up and get to work. - Chuck Close</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Overall, I couldn&rsquo;t recommend this book more but honestly don&rsquo;t just take my word for it and pick up a <a href=\"https://semi-rad.com/books/\">copy from the links on his website</a>. The best thing is it is a smaller-sized book so you can carry it with you on all of your adventures (well maybe not while running) so you can refer to the helpful motivational kick in the butt that is needed from time to time while doing anything. Honestly, I wish I had this book a couple of years back when I was content with just running a <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/09/30/k-a-day.html\">5k a day</a> as some days were harder to get motivated than others. As I am now running longer miles with slightly less frequency, I feel like this book helps keep me motivated to get out there.</p>\n",

In fact, for someone like myself who is planning on running a [Marathon](https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/07/08/it-is-official.html) later this year, I have already run about 37 marathons with the number of miles I have put in so far.\n\n>*Inspiration is for amateurs. The rest of us just show up and get to work. - Chuck Close*\n\nOverall, I couldn't recommend this book more but honestly don't just take my word for it and pick up a [copy from the links on his website](https://semi-rad.com/books/). The best thing is it is a smaller-sized book so you can carry it with you on all of your adventures (well maybe not while running) so you can refer to the helpful motivational kick in the butt that is needed from time to time while doing anything. Honestly, I wish I had this book a couple of years back when I was content with just running a [5k a day](https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/09/30/k-a-day.html) as some days were harder to get motivated than others. As I am now running longer miles with slightly less frequency, I feel like this book helps keep me motivated to get out there.\n\n",

Makes me wonder in other pictures I have taken if I would look closer I would find something interesting 😁.\n\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/a8626d73f4.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" />  \n\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/fd0e86b6e8.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" />  \n\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/4637ce0152.jpg\" width=\"226\" height=\"169\" alt=\"\" />\n",

If something would ever take the place with the same name it would have to take on a different form altogether in my opinion but at this point, I have no plans to have a comeback tour.  \n<br>\n##### **Won't you miss this?**  \nOf course, I will miss this, even though I haven't used it much in the last year I believe the site provided a lot of great value over the years. Also, it is something that was created, time was spent dreaming up ideas and executing various actions to make it what it was. It was a passion project and I honestly enjoyed every minute I worked on it even when I was looming over my head to get another task or post published.  \n<br>\n### **Closing**  \nI could go on and on but in closing, I will miss the community we had as this was such a fun project over the past 5 years, and even though I am the one saying Goodbye I will still miss it. Thanks to EVERYONE who helped pioneer and champion, or those who joined, contributed, and followed along in the past. I wish each and every one of you more success in your blogging careers!\n",

On the flip side, you could just include the interesting thoughts, photos, and articles throughout the week and share it out once.</p>\n<p>For now, I don't think this is something I would do but I do find it an interesting concept and would be very interested in knowing if anyone else has done this or thought about it too. </p>\n<p>My experience with just newsletters is that I have tried it a couple of times in the past but was never really sure what to put in a newsletter that I hadn't already shared via social media or posted on my blog.

				"title": "Treadmill vs Exercise Bike",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I have always liked the idea of an exercise bike. In fact, last December when my wife was talking about buying one over a treadmill I told her to go for it. I assumed since I run so much outside in all kinds of weather why would I choose to run inside and not really moving? I mean, I like to explore the outdoors in all seasons. Snow, Ice, Ran, wicked winds all of those don't deter me if I am planning on running or want to run. Even in smog-filled cities or cities, I don't even know where I am going I prefer to run outside than on the treadmill. So easy enough a bike for indoors makes sense then... Or does it...</p>\n<p>Over the past year, I have used the exercise bike 4 times, yep only 4, and one of them was in the first couple of days trying it out and the most recent time was today 😁. Don't get me wrong it isn't like the bike is buried away somewhere in the house so it is out of sight out of mind. In fact quite the opposite, since I have been working from home since March, it is in the same room as me so I can't really say I forgot about it 😁.</p>\n<p>After some reflection and conversation with friends, I realized I would have been better off with a treadmill. It wouldn't have taken the place of my running, well maybe once or twice but ultimately I could have been walking on it while on phone calls or watching TV. The times when I can't leave the house for a run but could move at a moderate clip to get some exercise in.</p>\n<p>\n  Now you might be thinking you could do the same with an exercise bike Eric! And yes, that is true but the difference is the key...\n  <br />\n</p>\n<p>\n  <b><i>You have to keep moving or you will fall on the treadmill vs exercise bike you can slow to a stop and not give the same movement or output.</i></b>\n</p>\n<p>That right there is my answer. On a treadmill, you have to just let your subconscious take over to keep your legs moving at the pace you set. If not well it might not end well...</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/3cff2b39c7.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n<p>On the bike, however, I have to monitor the pace and use brainpower to have my legs move at the speed I want because the bike will not keep moving and pushing me forward. That right there gives me too much room to fail.</p>\n<p>It isn't that I am not determined in my workouts or exercise routines. It is just I am smart about it, I know my body and sometimes I need to trick it or force its hand. A couple of weeks back I was thinking I should run further but wasn't sure I really wanted to. So what did I do? I ran more or less a loop that requires me to run the whole thing in order to get back. No short cuts or stopping early. The distance was going to be the distance so I might as well run it.</p>\n<p>So for me, Treadmills &gt; Exercise Bikes when it comes to a mindless activity to get your body moving.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Veil<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Eliot Peper (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->@EliotPeper<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) was just released a week ago and I really can’t say enough good things about it. If you are looking for a great book then look no further as Eliot has produced another great page-turner after not long ago finishing his most recent sequels.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>\n<em>The book was released on May 20th, 2020, but I was lucky enough to get an advanced copy from my good friend Eliot himself. However, I enjoyed the book so much that once it was released I purchased another copy as well for my collection.</em><br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nUnlike some of Eliot’s other books, I actually felt like this one started a little slower but that was a good thing. As with a lot of good books, it built you up getting to know the characters and backgrounds. Speaking of, the main character, Zia León seems like your normal humanitarian that leads various aid missions to help areas in need. However, what makes Zia unique is she comes with sass and attitude that fits her well in order to get the job done.</p>\n<p>As the first part of the story goes I was trying at times to see how all the pieces were going to fit together. Honestly, it took me a little while to start putting the pieces together, and then all of a sudden a kidnapping happened and I could not put this book down. Not only does the story speed up but more is revealed along the way that made it even more of a page-turner. I soon found out that the adventure was just beginning for Zia.</p>\n<p>Eliot does it again by looking into the near future and laying out what might happened due to various social/global issues that are relevant in today’s world. With his ability to research those relevant topics, expand on them to plausible future events and outcomes all while crafting other drama into the story always amazes me. Don’t get me wrong there is more to the story than just social events as friendships are tested, betrayal unfolds, and stubborn relationships rear their ugly heads. Everything centers around Zia and she must deal with them all along the way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final Thoughts</h3>\n<p>The one thing I appreciate about Eliot’s books is the way he sometimes weaves things from other books into the mix. I might have only caught one referring to an open-sourced software architecture 😃 but I am sure there were more. Additionally, he finds ways to weave current locations and eating establishments that again makes the futuristic feel of this book that much closer to home.</p>\n<p>I have really been enjoying Eliot’s near future books as the concepts and issues are not unrealistic to see come to fruition. Not to mention he always seems to be writing about topics that are big and bold and not just ones that change over the course of a year.</p>\n<p>This is again one of those books I really can&rsquo;t recommend enough.

				"content_text": "<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Veil-Eliot-Peper-ebook/dp/B085PSTJNC/?tag=stthink-20\">Veil</a> by Eliot Peper (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/eliotpeper\">@EliotPeper</a>) was just released a week ago and I really can’t say enough good things about it. If you are looking for a great book then look no further as Eliot has produced another great page-turner after not long ago finishing his most recent sequels.  \n\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Veil-Eliot-Peper-ebook/dp/B085PSTJNC/?tag=stthink-20\"><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/11f75ef022.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-51123504\" title=\"\"/></a>  \n_The book was released on May 20th, 2020, but I was lucky enough to get an advanced copy from my good friend Eliot himself. However, I enjoyed the book so much that once it was released I purchased another copy as well for my collection._  \n<br>\nUnlike some of Eliot’s other books, I actually felt like this one started a little slower but that was a good thing. As with a lot of good books, it built you up getting to know the characters and backgrounds. Speaking of, the main character, Zia León seems like your normal humanitarian that leads various aid missions to help areas in need. However, what makes Zia unique is she comes with sass and attitude that fits her well in order to get the job done.  \n\nAs the first part of the story goes I was trying at times to see how all the pieces were going to fit together. Honestly, it took me a little while to start putting the pieces together, and then all of a sudden a kidnapping happened and I could not put this book down. Not only does the story speed up but more is revealed along the way that made it even more of a page-turner. I soon found out that the adventure was just beginning for Zia.  \n\nEliot does it again by looking into the near future and laying out what might happened due to various social/global issues that are relevant in today’s world. With his ability to research those relevant topics, expand on them to plausible future events and outcomes all while crafting other drama into the story always amazes me. Don’t get me wrong there is more to the story than just social events as friendships are tested, betrayal unfolds, and stubborn relationships rear their ugly heads. Everything centers around Zia and she must deal with them all along the way.  \n\n### Final Thoughts  \nThe one thing I appreciate about Eliot’s books is the way he sometimes weaves things from other books into the mix. I might have only caught one referring to an open-sourced software architecture 😃 but I am sure there were more. Additionally, he finds ways to weave current locations and eating establishments that again makes the futuristic feel of this book that much closer to home.  \n\nI have really been enjoying Eliot’s near future books as the concepts and issues are not unrealistic to see come to fruition. Not to mention he always seems to be writing about topics that are big and bold and not just ones that change over the course of a year.  \n\nThis is again one of those books I really can't recommend enough. In a time where politics seems to be guiding best practices for how we deal with climate issues, this book takes you to the near future in the path we could be on.  \n\nTo make sure you don't miss out on his next books be sure to follow him on twitter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/eliotpeper\">@EliotPeper</a>) and subscribe to his newsletter from his website ([http://www.eliotpeper.com/](http://www.eliotpeper.com/)).  \n\n<br>\n\n<i>As I mentioned I have read some of Eliot's books before and wrote about them so if you are interested to check out some of his other books go for it as you won't be disappointed!

You will quickly find out in short drifting is just following along the status quo or coasting through life accepting everything that is happening.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large\"><p><i>“People do not decide their futures, they decide their habits and their habits decide their futures.”</i> </p><cite> <em>F.M. Alexander </em> </cite></blockquote>\n\n<p>As someone who has written about <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/02/19/power-of-the.html\">habits</a> before and not long ago had a very addicting habit that added up to <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/09/30/k-a-day.html\">a lot of miles being run</a>, I was very interested in seeing what the author had to say. Not too far into the book he hits you with some quick questions like <em>\"Are you feeling bored? Restless? Trapped?\"</em> and if your answers are yes then the solution is that <i><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">It's Time to Take Back Control of Your Life</span></i>.</p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell, that is what the book is really based on. The nice thing about this book, in my opinion, is that it is short and very consumable. However, not too short that he doesn't add some examples throughout each topic. However, It is really broken down into 4 parts which have simple enough concepts:</p>\n\n<h3>Awakening</h3>\n\n<p>Being aware as you cannot change what you are not aware of. Uncover the habits that are operating in your blind spots. Once your habits are brought out into light you can inspect them and disrupt them.</p>\n\n<h3>Disrupting</h3>\n\n<p>Disrupting is the process of interrupting your perpetual patterns and breaking the stimulus and response cycle. When you do this, you get immediate and profound feedback on why you do what you do, and how these habits may be serving or oppressing you.</p>\n\n<h3>Designing</h3>\n\n<p>The first two parts of the book are pretty straightforward as he talks about how to pretty much break down your current habits and thinking in order to get to the designing part. In the designing chapter he talks a lot about Ultimate authority and how to set compelling goals. This is where he talks about creating new habits that empower your future.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><i>Ultimate authority means taking responsibility for the fact that your life is the sum total of every decision you’ve ever made from the day you were born up until this very moment. This means you get to take credit for the many successes you’ve had. It also means the shit parts of your life are on you too.</i></p></blockquote>\n\n<h3>Sustaining</h3>\n\n<p>The part of the book I think makes the most sense. Obviously, if you have completed the above topics then you have to figure out a way to keep moving forward.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><i><b>The Awakening, Disrupting and Designing (ADD) Cycle we have just walked through in this book is a process that should be repeated and not a one-time exercise.</b></i></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>The above statement by the author was a great strategic point to make towards the end of the book for a reminder about sustaining. There are a lot of things we do in life thinking if we just do it once all is good. However, in reality, we need to continue to work on things no matter if it is trying to rid ourselves of excess possessions, weight, or anything else. Each day is a new day that you really have to tackle the problem again. The advantage you have as you build up the consecutive days is that it becomes a habit and less you might have to think about in the future.</p>\n\n<h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>\n\n<p>Overall, I enjoyed the book and if anything it made me think about various things I do and maybe things I have been thinking about changing or doing in my life but haven’t taken that next step. I really did enjoy that the book was a quick read as I could see myself flipping through the pages again at some point in time as it gives off a measure of motivation too.</p>\n\n<p>If you think the book would be interesting to you, it can be found on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077K9J6PT\">Amazon</a> or through the publisher’s website (<a href=\"https://www.tckpublishing.com/\">TCK Publishing</a>).</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>These days most of the reading I do is listening to someone read me a book. I have written about this before but I came across this tweet by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->James Clear<!-- raw HTML omitted --> laying out that audio is the biggest trend in books.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h3 id=\"ease-of-listening-using-smartphones-and-headphones\">Ease of Listening using Smartphones and Headphones</h3>\n<p>His first two points around the change in technology I can&rsquo;t disagree with at all. The increase/change in technology has allowed audiobooks to be much easier to listen too as the technology has provided a very low barrier of entry and use. You can take them with you on the go and not have to worry about finding a cassette or CD player. Yes, you read that right, I just said cassette player. I was in that era where we had walkmans and boomboxes. So not super compact if you wanted to go on a run or walk around the house listening to your book tape. In fact, the first vehicle I purchased out of college had both a cassette and a CD player. Now the van my wife and I just bought 2 years ago doesn&rsquo;t have either.</p>\n<p>The other change in technology that is similar but not specifically called out is a change in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->media type<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. As I just discussed with audiotapes and audio CDs, that is more physical stuff you needed to carry around. I remember renting an audiobook tape from the library back in 2004 and it had 10 tapes I had to carry around. I used to make a lot of trips to Chicago from Minneapolis so this is when I first started getting into book tapes as it was a way to pass the 7 hr drive by myself. However, I would have to always make sure to flip the tape or put in the next CD. Now you don&rsquo;t even have to mess with physical media as you can just download it on your phone, or tablet and go. In addition, it is much easier to get audiobooks, you can still get them for free from the library but now instead of having to go to the library to pick up your cassettes or CDs, you can just download them from Overdrive or something else your library might be connected with. Also, if you can&rsquo;t get them from the library or don&rsquo;t want to be put on the waitlist, you can quickly buy them though Audible or other platforms and pretty much listen to it instantly.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <em>Image by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Welcome to all and thank you for your visit ! ツ<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pixabay<!-- raw HTML omitted --></em></p>\n<h3 id=\"everyone-loves-convenience\">Everyone loves Convenience</h3>\n<p>The third point he makes is the one that is maybe more concerning but even more spot on. I say that it is concerning as I am one of those people. Every year I have this idea in my head I am going to physically read more books but every year I only get though enough to count on one hand. Most of the ones I read like that are advanced copies I get from a friend show writes some pretty amazing books. Honestly, it is the convenience that I continue to stick with audiobooks because I can listen to them while doing a number of other things. I still don&rsquo;t know if that is a great thing to always multitask while listening to books but I don&rsquo;t see myself changing that. Most of the time it is when I am running or driving to work. For both of those activities, audiobooks are the perfect multitasking initiative. Also, both of those activities for me have a defined starting and stopping point that doesn&rsquo;t allow it to flow into other activities.</p>\n<p>Another article I was reading titled <!-- raw HTML omitted -->“The Rise and Rise of the Books you Don’t read”<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Clare Thorp touched on a lot of other interesting benefits around audiobooks but one part in there was a different look at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Convenience <!-- raw HTML omitted -->topic above.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->“Often audio <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is not <!-- raw HTML omitted -->competing with time spent with books,” says Richard Lennon, publisher at Penguin Audio. “It’s people who are either fitting books and authors into their day in new ways, so people who might be existing readers but have found that during their commute or exercising or cooking dinner, there’s an opportunity to listen. Or it’s an alternative to TV for people who are conscious of their screen time.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bingo!<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Richard validated that a lot of the times when I personally listen to books are times I would not have been sitting on the couch reading a physical book. As it would be hard to run down the streets in the morning with a physical book in my hands.</p>\n<p>However, I do listen to audiobooks sometimes in the evening as I am doing small tasks around the house.

				"content_text": "These days most of the reading I do is listening to someone read me a book.

A huge win.</p>— James Clear (@JamesClear) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1220769946365571073?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 24, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/97123464c3.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"259\" alt=\"\" />   Honestly, he nailed this in my opinion.  \n\n### Ease of Listening using Smartphones and Headphones\nHis first two points around the change in technology I can't disagree with at all. The increase/change in technology has allowed audiobooks to be much easier to listen too as the technology has provided a very low barrier of entry and use. You can take them with you on the go and not have to worry about finding a cassette or CD player. Yes, you read that right, I just said cassette player. I was in that era where we had walkmans and boomboxes. So not super compact if you wanted to go on a run or walk around the house listening to your book tape. In fact, the first vehicle I purchased out of college had both a cassette and a CD player. Now the van my wife and I just bought 2 years ago doesn't have either.  \n\nThe other change in technology that is similar but not specifically called out is a change in <b>media type</b>. As I just discussed with audiotapes and audio CDs, that is more physical stuff you needed to carry around. I remember renting an audiobook tape from the library back in 2004 and it had 10 tapes I had to carry around. I used to make a lot of trips to Chicago from Minneapolis so this is when I first started getting into book tapes as it was a way to pass the 7 hr drive by myself. However, I would have to always make sure to flip the tape or put in the next CD. Now you don't even have to mess with physical media as you can just download it on your phone, or tablet and go. In addition, it is much easier to get audiobooks, you can still get them for free from the library but now instead of having to go to the library to pick up your cassettes or CDs, you can just download them from Overdrive or something else your library might be connected with. Also, if you can't get them from the library or don't want to be put on the waitlist, you can quickly buy them though Audible or other platforms and pretty much listen to it instantly.  \n\n\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/89fa39d716.jpg\" width=\"575\" height=\"381\" alt=\"\" />  *Image by <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/users/janeb13-725943/?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=image&utm_content=1176161\">Welcome to all and thank you for your visit ! ツ</a> from <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=image&utm_content=1176161\">Pixabay</a>*  \n\n### Everyone loves Convenience\nThe third point he makes is the one that is maybe more concerning but even more spot on. I say that it is concerning as I am one of those people. Every year I have this idea in my head I am going to physically read more books but every year I only get though enough to count on one hand. Most of the ones I read like that are advanced copies I get from a friend show writes some pretty amazing books. Honestly, it is the convenience that I continue to stick with audiobooks because I can listen to them while doing a number of other things. I still don't know if that is a great thing to always multitask while listening to books but I don't see myself changing that. Most of the time it is when I am running or driving to work. For both of those activities, audiobooks are the perfect multitasking initiative. Also, both of those activities for me have a defined starting and stopping point that doesn't allow it to flow into other activities.  \n\nAnother article I was reading titled <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20200104-audiobooks-the-rise-and-rise-of-the-books-you-dont-read\">“The Rise and Rise of the Books you Don’t read”</a> by Clare Thorp touched on a lot of other interesting benefits around audiobooks but one part in there was a different look at the <b>Convenience </b>topic above.\n\n><i>“Often audio <b>is not </b>competing with time spent with books,” says Richard Lennon, publisher at Penguin Audio. “It’s people who are either fitting books and authors into their day in new ways, so people who might be existing readers but have found that during their commute or exercising or cooking dinner, there’s an opportunity to listen. Or it’s an alternative to TV for people who are conscious of their screen time.”</i>\n\n<b>Bingo!</b> Richard validated that a lot of the times when I personally listen to books are times I would not have been sitting on the couch reading a physical book. As it would be hard to run down the streets in the morning with a physical book in my hands.  \n\nHowever, I do listen to audiobooks sometimes in the evening as I am doing small tasks around the house. The only issue with this is that it translates into not just sitting on the couch and relaxing or winding down. It then has me wandering all around the house doing various projects and tasks. Then what ultimately ends up happening is that I continue to listen to it much longer and stay up later than I was anticipating. These are the times that go against what Richard was talking about as it isn’t really a new way and I just cut out a good way to get back to physical books. In fact, these specifically are the times I should have reached for the physical book instead and the more times I don’t I find the more times I don’t even think about physical books.  \n\n### So are you going to change any of your habits?\nProbably not. Honestly, I do know I am taking the easier way out by listening to books instead of physically reading them but it works for me. Maybe when I am older and have some more time on my hands to sit by a fire or on my couch in the afternoon I will read more physical (or even digital) books.  \n\nFor now, they are a good companion while running and driving to work so I don't see that changing. The only thing I might try to change very slightly is to listen to less in the evening in a way to either try to read a physical book or do something else with my time.  \n\n<i><b>How about you?

I do think how he accomplished them is very interesting and sheds some light on how he thought about things differently during his command. In fact, many of his stories are how he tried doing something one way only to talk through and come up with a better way. It goes to show you that he too was learning through the process from day one.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><b><em>Of course, trying something new is never easy.

Michael Abrashoff</cite></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, as much as I enjoyed the book I feel how it was laid out did not necessarily flow as well as I would have liked as I feel he repeated himself from time to time. The reason for that is obvious as he was breaking down chapters into Management topics and not in the chronological order that events happened. It is just something to think about as sometimes I was trying to figure out in what order he started to do certain things or implementing new tactics.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Takeaways</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Different than some of my other book reviews I am going to just write out a couple of notes I took that may or may not be helpful to you. Now as I mentioned the book is very focused from a managers prespective. However, the notes I took could be turned inward as well. Depending on your line of business or work you do because in all honesty aren’t we kind of an employee even if it is for ourselves?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As I read the book the following themes stuck out to me that could be used in any situation depending on how you read it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Lead by Example</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This seems to go without saying. Can you actually do what you are asking others to do? Also, if you got different results than you were expecting to ask yourself his simple questions:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>Did I clearly articulate the goals?</li><li>Did I give people enough time and resources to accomplish the task?</li><li>Did I give them enough training?</li><li>Listen Aggressively</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Abrashoff got personal in his discussions with the crew while learning about their personal lives, why they joined the Navy and their thoughts on how to improve the ship. By taking the time to listen and not just give orders he discovered that he had a crew of smart, talented, and innovative men and women, but they weren’t being heard. This can be true in many interactions today, sometimes the best thing to do is listen to the other people instead of making sure your voice is heard. You might find something out that can be more beneficial to your purpose or goal.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Communicate with Purpose</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>No matter how fantastic your message is, if no one is receiving it, you aren’t communicating. It is up to you to clearly define the mission and vision of the organization and then to communicate clearly and concisely.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Take risks</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Everyone in an organization must feel comfortable taking calculated risks. The key is to know the parameters in which they can take those calculated risks and that everyone understands that you might not always win. Remember to not over encourage perfection as it will limit your ability to think creatively and take risks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Praise</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As a manager myself I found this one spot on with his quote.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><i><b>Show me a manager that ignores the power of praise and I will show you a lousy manager, praise is infinitely more powerful than punishment.</b></i></p><cite>Captain D. Michael Abrashoff</cite></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, as with most of these points above, the simple act of giving praise to someone even if you don’t have a working relationship as the book describes can go a long way. There are a lot of people putting stuff out there and the act of giving recognition might seem small for you but 100x the effect for the person receiving it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I would recommend this book as I found it an interesting read with a couple of good takeaways.  I don't think this book is for everyone as some of the takeaways can be found in other books. However, I enjoyed hearing the stories of how Captain Abrashoff achieved his success.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

When the alarm went off I was just too comfortable laying in bed that I stayed there for a really long time. Finally, after a lot of time ticked by I told myself I had wasted enough time laying around and I should get outside to run. However, I figured I only had time for 3.1 mile route instead of the one I was planning on doing. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":51123379,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/c9b6296589.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-51123379\"/><figcaption>Looking at the sunrise after a great long run (December 2019, Eden Prairie)</figcaption></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Being a little bummed about not doing what I had planned, I was glad that I got outside to do something instead of skipping it altogether, which was also on my mind. I didn’t feel great running at first either so I knew just sticking to an easier route was a good plan so then I could get home and have some time before I rushed off to work. However, as I looked at my watch and realized I was at about 2 miles into my run and approaching my house I thought why not just continue and run another 3.1 mile loop that goes a different direction.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So that is just what I did and I continued on a different route.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote {\"className\":\"is-style-default\"} -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p><i><b>“It’s not so much that I began to run, but that I continued”</b></i></p><cite>Hal Higdon</cite></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>You might be wondering why I shared the story above with you but stick with me and read on :)</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was glad to have extended my total run to the full 6.2 miles I had planned to run the night before. Even though I took a completely different route than planning, I ultimately achieved the same goal I set out to accomplish.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Reflection on Paths and Moving Forward</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As I reflected on that driving to work today I realized a lot of people (me included) focus too much about what path we planned to be on in order to reach our end goal. However, by being so focused on the current path we could be losing sight of what we really want as an end goal. In fact, we could miss a turn that might take us off the current route but still headed in the right direction overall.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This has happened to me quite a few times most specifically in careers or jobs. I know what I would like to be doing down the road from now or how that might look. However, sometimes I get so stuck in a role (path) thinking it will eventually get me there as I had originally planned. Then another year goes by and I realize I am no closer to where I would like to end up and in reality, I might be further behind or off track. If only I would have stopped ignoring other interesting routes that would probably lead me to the same destination as my goal.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ultimately, I am beginning to learn that taking small steps and keeping the course is a good thing in life as long as you continue to move forward. However, you should make sure you are aware of your surroundings and make sure you aren’t just following a path because that was your original plan. You also need to make sure you are keeping your head up and making sure you aren’t so focused on the trail in front of you that you might be passing up other opportunities.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

If so I would be curious about what it is, how it works, does it cost you anything and if you feel you have gained any value from it? Feel free to leave a comment below.</p>\n<p>I have been a part of a couple over the years and today I want to talk about the Break the Twitch Member Community. I have been a member since the beginning and I will say it has definitely been worth the value I paid and continue to pay. Not only do I get to help keep the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Break the Twitch website<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Podcast<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ad-free but also get access to an amazing community of supporting individuals and other resources. In the community specifically, you will find both Anthony and his wife Amy who are active by either leading and/or contributing to discussions.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Now time to interrupt my normal style of writing with some questions and answering in order to fill in the blanks of why this post exists.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ithis-is-great-why-are-you-telling-me-this-is-it-a-sales-pitch-are-you-going-to-get-a-commission-on-thisi\"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is great why are you telling me this, is it a sales pitch? Are you going to get a commission on this?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h4>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->NO<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->NO<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This is not a sales pitch and I don’t get anything if you would happen to sign up. Well, I guess technically I get to have you in the community if you sign up so that is something. The real reason I am talking about the Break the Twitch Member Community is to get the word out there. I have been a part of the community for almost 2 years and figured it was time to give a little extra back as I realized that I have never talked about it or said I had joined.</p>\n<h4 id=\"iso-why-did-you-joini\"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So why did you join?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h4>\n<p>It seems like a fair place to start out. I have been part of communities before and the best communities are made better by the people in them. Each member (the creators are included in this one) is supporting each other along their own journey. Some of our journeys are the same but others are wildly different. That doesn’t matter though because the other members can help become your support system for you to do the tasks or things that matter most.</p>\n<p>When I originally joined there were not many of us as it just launched. I didn’t hesitate as I have followed Break the Twitch for years and felt like this way one way for me to give back to a creator trying to create something to help people. Also, I believed in what Anthony was saying from the beginning. A little fun fact, I looked back in all of the posts I have had on this site and I have talked about Break the Twitch more times than I remembered (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->One Decision<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Power of the Habit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fall Clean up and Clean out<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>\n<h4 id=\"ii-have-been-part-of-communities-before-and-they-sometimes-fizzle-or-conversations-die-out-how-is-the-btt-community-and-why-would-it-be-betteri\"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have been part of Communities before and they sometimes fizzle or conversations die out. How is the BTT Community and why would it be better?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h4>\n<p>I too have been part of other communities before and in fact, started one that I feel is in that dying out phase of life (more on that other time). By my own experiences in communities, I have found that the best communities need champions and that is where you have Anthony and Amy actively engaging with people in the community. Not to mention all of the other members have some motivation to be active as well because there was a reason we all joined, to begin with. Additionally, since everyone is paying something to be a part of it that brings an increased level of commitment on everyone&rsquo;s part.</p>\n<h4 id=\"isounds-great-but-i-dont-really-want-to-be-active-in-a-community-right-now-or-what-if-i-get-busy-and-cant-be-active-in-the-community-wouldnt-that-mean-i-will-not-really-be-getting-my-valuei\"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sounds great but I don’t really want to be active in a community right now or what if I get busy and can’t be active in the community. Wouldn’t that mean I will not really be getting my value?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h4>\n<p>Another great question and to be honest I am that person a lot of the time. I will not lie I am not the best community contributor. I come in and out of discussions all of the time. It is not that I don’t find value in the discussion or monthly challenges they have. Trust me they are all great things, but for me, it comes down to my other priorities and which one fits for me at the given month/time. There is always value to be gained as the Break the Twitch Membership allows you access to a library of Audio courses that you have access to all the time. For someone that travels and spending a lot of time running around the streets, these courses are great to load on my phone and hit the road.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ididnt-you-meet-anthony-is-that-skewing-your-thoughts-herei\"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Didn’t you meet Anthony? Is that skewing your thoughts here?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h4>\n<p>Yes, and no. I did meet Anthony for the first time a couple of years back before the Membership community was open. As I said before I had been following Break the Twitch for some time and since we lived in the same area it made it easy to meet up. Meeting him in person confirmed what I had originally thought that he seemed like a super easy to talk to, down to earth, and overall really nice guy. I would have joined the membership community even if I had never met him. However, I will say the way he presents himself on the podcast, and in the Member Community group is how he is in real life.</p>\n<p>Speaking of meeting with him, now granted you might not be able to meet him in person as I did, but after signing up you can take him up on the offer of a 20 min coaching call. Not to mention you can interact with him in the Community chat group.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ifinal-thoughtsi\"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Final Thoughts<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h3>\n<p>Hope you enjoyed this different style of post today. It came about based on a discussion with someone about the community. In addition, I had just completed the longest run I have done in years and some of it is thanks to the Podcast going in my ears that kept pushing me along.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions for me about the Community let me know in the comments below as I am more than happy to answer them. Otherwise, I would suggest you check out the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Break the Twitch Community<!-- raw HTML omitted --> page as it has some FAQs at the bottom. Lastly, feel free to reach out to Anthony as you can find him on social media or his email at the bottom of the linked page above.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",

Not only do I get to help keep the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Break the Twitch website (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.breakthetwitch.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Break the Twitch website</a> and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"podcast (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.breakthetwitch.com/podcast-overview/\" target=\"_blank\">Podcast</a> ad-free but also get access to an amazing community of supporting individuals and other resources. In the community specifically, you will find both Anthony and his wife Amy who are active by either leading and/or contributing to discussions.  \n\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/7024210b22.png\" alt=\"Break the twitch logo\" title=\"break-the-twitch-logo.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"384\" height=\"384\" />  \n\nNow time to interrupt my normal style of writing with some questions and answering in order to fill in the blanks of why this post exists.\n\n#### <i>This is great why are you telling me this, is it a sales pitch? Are you going to get a commission on this?</i>  \n<b><u>NO</u></b> and <b><u>NO</u></b>. This is not a sales pitch and I don’t get anything if you would happen to sign up. Well, I guess technically I get to have you in the community if you sign up so that is something. The real reason I am talking about the Break the Twitch Member Community is to get the word out there. I have been a part of the community for almost 2 years and figured it was time to give a little extra back as I realized that I have never talked about it or said I had joined.  \n\n#### <i>So why did you join?</i>  \nIt seems like a fair place to start out. I have been part of communities before and the best communities are made better by the people in them. Each member (the creators are included in this one) is supporting each other along their own journey. Some of our journeys are the same but others are wildly different. That doesn’t matter though because the other members can help become your support system for you to do the tasks or things that matter most.  \n\nWhen I originally joined there were not many of us as it just launched. I didn’t hesitate as I have followed Break the Twitch for years and felt like this way one way for me to give back to a creator trying to create something to help people. Also, I believed in what Anthony was saying from the beginning. A little fun fact, I looked back in all of the posts I have had on this site and I have talked about Break the Twitch more times than I remembered (<a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2018/12/06/one-decision.html\">One Decision</a>, <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/02/19/power-of-the.html\">Power of the Habit</a>, <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2017/10/05/fall-clean-up.html\">Fall Clean up and Clean out</a>).  \n\n#### <i>I have been part of Communities before and they sometimes fizzle or conversations die out. How is the BTT Community and why would it be better?</i>  \nI too have been part of other communities before and in fact, started one that I feel is in that dying out phase of life (more on that other time). By my own experiences in communities, I have found that the best communities need champions and that is where you have Anthony and Amy actively engaging with people in the community. Not to mention all of the other members have some motivation to be active as well because there was a reason we all joined, to begin with. Additionally, since everyone is paying something to be a part of it that brings an increased level of commitment on everyone's part.  \n\n#### <i>Sounds great but I don’t really want to be active in a community right now or what if I get busy and can’t be active in the community. Wouldn’t that mean I will not really be getting my value?</i>  \nAnother great question and to be honest I am that person a lot of the time. I will not lie I am not the best community contributor. I come in and out of discussions all of the time. It is not that I don’t find value in the discussion or monthly challenges they have. Trust me they are all great things, but for me, it comes down to my other priorities and which one fits for me at the given month/time. There is always value to be gained as the Break the Twitch Membership allows you access to a library of Audio courses that you have access to all the time. For someone that travels and spending a lot of time running around the streets, these courses are great to load on my phone and hit the road.  \n\n#### <i>Didn’t you meet Anthony? Is that skewing your thoughts here?</i>  \nYes, and no. I did meet Anthony for the first time a couple of years back before the Membership community was open. As I said before I had been following Break the Twitch for some time and since we lived in the same area it made it easy to meet up. Meeting him in person confirmed what I had originally thought that he seemed like a super easy to talk to, down to earth, and overall really nice guy. I would have joined the membership community even if I had never met him. However, I will say the way he presents himself on the podcast, and in the Member Community group is how he is in real life.  \n\nSpeaking of meeting with him, now granted you might not be able to meet him in person as I did, but after signing up you can take him up on the offer of a 20 min coaching call. Not to mention you can interact with him in the Community chat group.  \n\n### <i>Final Thoughts</i>  \nHope you enjoyed this different style of post today. It came about based on a discussion with someone about the community. In addition, I had just completed the longest run I have done in years and some of it is thanks to the Podcast going in my ears that kept pushing me along.  \n\nIf you have any questions for me about the Community let me know in the comments below as I am more than happy to answer them. Otherwise, I would suggest you check out the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.breakthetwitch.com/community/\" target=\"_blank\">Break the Twitch Community</a> page as it has some FAQs at the bottom. Lastly, feel free to reach out to Anthony as you can find him on social media or his email at the bottom of the linked page above.  \n\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/9bd5dbc608.jpg\" alt=\"Break the Twitch\" class=\"wp-image-51123310\" width=\"640\" height=\"640\"/>  \n©<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B08TGJInEkX/\">Break the Twitch</a>\n",

Both of those things require some infrastructure that needs to be stored in the off-seasons. I don’t mind having to put it away but when this happens it always becomes a day project as it gives me some time to really clean up the other clutter that has been accumulating during the other 3-6 months.</p>\n<p>I have written before about how we have used <!-- raw HTML omitted -->House Projects to Help Declutter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as well as using the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Seasons<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to help clean up areas of our house as well. However, most of all of that energy in decluttering started after I read the book “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The More of Less<!-- raw HTML omitted -->” by Joshua Becker. Not only did the book energize me to start some of those decluttering projects around my house but also the book gave me access to a course that connected me with a community of people who wanted to and were going through the same process.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Uncluttered<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was the course and it was great because it was only a 12-week course focusing on various aspects of becoming uncluttered. However, in reality, the underlying message was not to just trash everything and live in a house with nothing. No… because who would really want to do that. The course walked you through how to figure out what is important to you and helps challenge your thinking of what is important so in the end, you hopefully will know exactly what is important and lift the weight by removing the other “stuff” cluttering your life.</p>\n<p>The best part about the course is that you get lifetime access. So for someone like me, I enjoy that because I have done the course a couple of different times. Not only as a refresher but also as a way to get motivated again. As I said at the beginning of this article, I have two big clean-up events every year due to the infrastructure of outside stuff I need to put away. I am approaching one right now and even though I would love to say I decluttered our house once and after that, all was well… Well, that is not the case, it is something you have to intentionally work at going forward because let&rsquo;s face it everyone is busy and stuff can start to pile up again. So for me retaking this course that continues to inspire me is time and initial money well spent.</p>\n<p><em>Ok, I need to make something clear because I do not want you to think I am trying to pull one over on you.

I don’t mind having to put it away but when this happens it always becomes a day project as it gives me some time to really clean up the other clutter that has been accumulating during the other 3-6 months.  \n\nI have written before about how we have used <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2017/10/25/using-house-projects.html\">House Projects to Help Declutter</a> as well as using the <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2017/10/05/fall-clean-up.html\">Seasons</a> to help clean up areas of our house as well. However, most of all of that energy in decluttering started after I read the book “<a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/05/31/the-more-of.html\">The More of Less</a>” by Joshua Becker. Not only did the book energize me to start some of those decluttering projects around my house but also the book gave me access to a course that connected me with a community of people who wanted to and were going through the same process.  \n\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/1f973eaa3c.jpg\" alt=\"2019 Uncluttered\" class=\"wp-image-51123250\"/>  \n\n<a href=\"https://uncluttered.samcart.com/referral/kwVBIyfN/KLDewKhkPXB2B00D\">Uncluttered</a> was the course and it was great because it was only a 12-week course focusing on various aspects of becoming uncluttered. However, in reality, the underlying message was not to just trash everything and live in a house with nothing. No… because who would really want to do that. The course walked you through how to figure out what is important to you and helps challenge your thinking of what is important so in the end, you hopefully will know exactly what is important and lift the weight by removing the other “stuff” cluttering your life.  \n\nThe best part about the course is that you get lifetime access. So for someone like me, I enjoy that because I have done the course a couple of different times. Not only as a refresher but also as a way to get motivated again. As I said at the beginning of this article, I have two big clean-up events every year due to the infrastructure of outside stuff I need to put away. I am approaching one right now and even though I would love to say I decluttered our house once and after that, all was well… Well, that is not the case, it is something you have to intentionally work at going forward because let's face it everyone is busy and stuff can start to pile up again. So for me retaking this course that continues to inspire me is time and initial money well spent.  \n\n*Ok, I need to make something clear because I do not want you to think I am trying to pull one over on you. I know the previous paragraph seemed a little sales pitchy. Note that is not my intention,  I am only telling you things from my own experience and no one is paying me to write this article. I would not try to convince you that something is good if I have never used it before and given it a try.*\n",

Not because I am trying to hide anything, in fact, you can follow <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/athletes/ericmwalk\">my Strava account</a> if you are a runner and like doing that type of thing. The reason was that the data is not perfect and it took me some time putting it all together. I am not going to bore you with all of those details in this post as I might have to save those issues for another. However, all of the data in the charts came from <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/\">Strava</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fitbit.com/\">Fitbit</a>.  \n<br>\nSo without further ado, here are some fun charts to look at from the past year where I completed 1189.45 miles with a little color commentary.  \n\n## When did you run?  \nThis is one of the first questions I got after my previous post, When did I do most of my running? I have been asked this question by friends and family members before and without looking at the chart my answer was always the morning without a doubt. With 3 kids in activities, the morning was the one time I could really control what I did. If I didn’t do it first thing there was always a chance that plans could change and I would be doing it at midnight. However, it did get me thinking about how often I ran the rest of the day over the past 12 months.  \n\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/35173af475.jpg\" alt=\"\"/>  \nAs you can see morning took it by a landslide. Now that it is Fall again and almost time for Winter I was reminded that running in the dark is not my favorite as I have been spoiled for the last 3-4 months of the morning running with the sunrise. This morning I just cranked out 6 miles and it was all in darkness….  \n<br>\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/f79835fb4b.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"51123229\"/>  \n*Always a win when I would find a new route that actually has some street lights (Septemeber 2018, Eden Prairie, MN)*  \n<br>\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/3c38defd81.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"51123232\"/>  \n*Completed my annual self made \"Turkey Trot\" in the early morning hours while watching the sunrise (November 2018, Nevada, IA)*  \n<br>\nNow being the data nerd I am I was thinking the next best slice would be to see a number of runs/miles by the day of the week. I was interested to see that I ran fewer miles on the weekend than I did during the week.  \n<br>\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/87a9e1be53.jpg\" alt=\"\"/>  \n<br>\nNow here is where I am going to kind of skate over data quality because it might be more valuable in another post as I will probably rant quite a bit on that topic. However, I have some double runs during the middle of some weeks due to international flights. In addition, not to play down my commitment to running because there were a couple of times in the past year I ran twice a day by CHOICE! You read that right I chose to run not only in the morning but at night as well. Don’t worry I didn’t make a habit out of it and it only happened because as I said previously I sometimes had to plan a week out in advance. Obviously, since I mostly wanted to get my runs done early as a way to not forget, someone would message me mid-day seeing if I wanted to run that evening. I mean how could I say no?  \n\n## Friday Mornings take the real WIN!  \nAfter looking at that last set of data I pondered if there was anything else I would like to see. That is when it hit me that it would be interesting to see based on the day of the week when did I typically run.  \n\nI was not really sure what to expect on this chart before pulling it together. The only thing I could think of was besides mornings probably being pretty spread out during a given week. I would have thought more evening runs as I would try to squeeze them in right after work or while at a kid's activity. As you can see from the data below, that is not entirely what is being shown.  \n\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/fdefdfdb5f.jpg\" alt=\"\"/>  \n\nAfter looking over the chart below I came to two realizations:\n<ol><li>I am not sure how Strava categorizes Morning, Lunch, Afternoon, Evening or Night run. The biggest problem I see here is that there is a big gap between what I would consider Morning and Lunch. Then in the afternoon and evening, I am not sure what that fine line is to trip it from Lunch to Afternoon to evening. I spot checked a couple of specific days and it was counting afternoon as 5:50 PM. Not sure if that is where it should fall but then the data started to make more sense as in the winter months for sure I ran more in the early evening (or still Afternoon) while my son played basketball.</li><li>I made a concerted effort to never run at night on Friday and in fact, it was the heaviest day of morning runs. I had never really thought of it but accept what the data says. Most of my Friday nights kids don’t have activities so with that in mind we are either doing something as a family at home or traveling somewhere for the weekend. Not to mention if you want to have a drink with the neighbor while grilling after work on a Friday it is best to get you run in early.</li></ol>\n<br>\nI also did a similar slice based on miles but as you can see it didn’t really tell me anything as the chart looks about the same since I was always hovering around 3.1 miles with very rare exceptions though most of and then at the end.  \n\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/ef806307e5.jpg\" alt=\"\"/>  \n\n## Pace\nFinally, after I was pulling all this data together I was wondering what was my average pace over the course of these 12 months. The overall answer is 7:47 min miles. I decided to create some quick average charts by day and month. The day chart kind of puzzled me except when thinking about the other data above.

There was a time I distanced myself from running in my later college years up until about 4 years ago. I actually wrote about it a couple of times ok maybe more than a couple but I wrote about it when I got <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Back into Running<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and when I was using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Running to Refocus<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>There is something great about running as it is just PURE. You can only move as fast as YOU can, as far as YOU want, and as long as YOU can. However, it is all up to YOU to determine what YOU “can” do and what you get out of it.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h2 id=\"planning-is-key\">Planning is Key</h2>\n<p>Honestly, this is the biggest takeaway I learned over the past year was planning. If you want to make something a priority you need to plan time for it in order for it to be a priority. For me in order to make running a priority in my life, I had to make sure to keep it a priority, and sometimes I had to get creative. I would look at my schedule on a day to day or even a week out and figure out when I planned to run. This sounds a little crazy that on a Sunday night I was already planning on when I was going to run the following Saturday but honestly I had to do it. Not just for when it would make sense to me, like running in the morning, but for my family and other work priorities. I found myself running early in the morning, late at night, and sometimes squeezing it in while my son was at a birthday party. Then there was the weather. That would always through a wrench in it if I would have let it. However, after my habit was formed I just told myself it didn’t matter the weather, rain or shine, snow or ice, 100 degrees and humid or 0 degrees with a negative windchill, I would make sure to get my run in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"around-the-neighborhood\">Around the Neighborhood</h2>\n<p>Something that I have enjoyed over the past 4 years of running is exploring my surroundings. In my neighborhood, I have found so many small parks, trails, and green spaces that I didn’t know existed in the first 6 years we lived there. Mostly because I would just drive by and not give it a second look. However, by increasing my mileage as well as the frequency of runs, I found myself exploring more places because I needed more routes and I was going farther.<br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nAlso, in my town and some of the surrounding areas, I went to other parks not near my house in order to find a new and interesting place to run. Some of which I then took my family back to so would could all explore at a later time to really take in the scenery.<br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <em>Enjoying the new scenery on an early evening run that was a lot harder than I anticipated (June 2019, Richard T.

				"content_text": "I ran a 5K a day for 365 Days in a row and counting… Most people will think that is crazy and pointless. I have run well over 1131.5 miles over the course of the past year (<em>check out the </em><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/10/03/k-a-day.html\"><em>data analysis</em></a><em> of all my runs or give a listen to the <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2020/02/18/off-the-couch.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2020/02/18/off-the-couch.html\">Off the Couch podcast</a> I was on talking about it</em>). On September 17th, 2018 I started this journey but I didn’t have the goal of a 5K a day in my mind. Or certainly, my intention was not to do it for an entire year.\n<br>\n## Background \nI have always been a runner, or so I say I have always been a runner. There was a time I distanced myself from running in my later college years up until about 4 years ago. I actually wrote about it a couple of times ok maybe more than a couple but I wrote about it when I got <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/02/09/back-to-running.html\">Back into Running</a> and when I was using <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/03/02/running-to-refocus.html\">Running to Refocus</a>.\n<br>\n>*There is something great about running as it is just PURE. You can only move as fast as YOU can, as far as YOU want, and as long as YOU can. However, it is all up to YOU to determine what YOU “can” do and what you get out of it.*\n\n<br>\nHowever, last fall I finally decided to run with my neighbor who has always run more miles than my typical 2-2.5 mile run about 2-3x per week. That day we went for 4 miles on a Saturday morning and it was great. Not to mention I felt really good. For the next week, I decided to keep with my 2-3 times a week but stretched myself to hit 3+ miles of which one was 6 miles. I kept that up for a couple of weeks when I then decided I wanted more. I wasn’t sure I had more time to run more miles in a given day, so the next best thing was to try to run a 5K (3.1 miles) every single day for a week. It didn’t seem as hard as I thought it was going to be keeping that up for a week so then I thought I would go for 2 weeks, then a full month. After, the month I figured I should do it for 3 months as that put me in January and I figured it would be too cold then. However, once January came along it was so ingrained into my daily habit that a 5K a day was just the normal. It became so normal in fact that I would just start planning my day around it. It was almost a non-negotiable item, no matter if I had to wake up at 5:00 AM to get an early morning run in or if I was doing it at 10:30 PM at night, I was going to get a run in.  \n\n## Planning is Key\nHonestly, this is the biggest takeaway I learned over the past year was planning. If you want to make something a priority you need to plan time for it in order for it to be a priority. For me in order to make running a priority in my life, I had to make sure to keep it a priority, and sometimes I had to get creative. I would look at my schedule on a day to day or even a week out and figure out when I planned to run. This sounds a little crazy that on a Sunday night I was already planning on when I was going to run the following Saturday but honestly I had to do it. Not just for when it would make sense to me, like running in the morning, but for my family and other work priorities. I found myself running early in the morning, late at night, and sometimes squeezing it in while my son was at a birthday party. Then there was the weather. That would always through a wrench in it if I would have let it. However, after my habit was formed I just told myself it didn’t matter the weather, rain or shine, snow or ice, 100 degrees and humid or 0 degrees with a negative windchill, I would make sure to get my run in.  \n\n## Around the Neighborhood\nSomething that I have enjoyed over the past 4 years of running is exploring my surroundings. In my neighborhood, I have found so many small parks, trails, and green spaces that I didn’t know existed in the first 6 years we lived there. Mostly because I would just drive by and not give it a second look. However, by increasing my mileage as well as the frequency of runs, I found myself exploring more places because I needed more routes and I was going farther.  \n<br>\nAlso, in my town and some of the surrounding areas, I went to other parks not near my house in order to find a new and interesting place to run. Some of which I then took my family back to so would could all explore at a later time to really take in the scenery.  \n<br>\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/2221133496.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"51123075\"/>  *Enjoying the new scenery on an early evening run that was a lot harder than I anticipated (June 2019, Richard T.

I always knew who Scott Jurek was but I for some reason I didn't really realize he had run the Appalachian Trail and/or wrote a book about it. So as a runner myself I figured this would be the perfect book to listen to. The book chronicles Scott’s 2015 attempt at the Application Trail FKT (fastest known time) that he made with the assistance of his wife Jenny. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>Overall, I would suggest “North” to anyone that enjoys running or hiking.</em></strong> Not to say if you didn’t enjoy running or hiking you wouldn’t find this interesting but I do think you can relate to some points in the story.

It was interesting hearing what Jenny was thinking during the time as well as she could tell her husband Scott was hurting at times but also gave some insight into all that went on behind the scenes to assist while he was out running the trail. Also, the book is about so much more, you hear about their suffering, friendship, marriage, ego, and doubt.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>From the beginning of the story, you are dropped into the picture with Jenny and Scott discussing life and what is next. Scott seems to want something else out of life as he realizes he has been on autopilot. He wanted to capture the uncertainty and excitement that comes with putting yourself into an extreme challenge. Not to mention, he and his wife Jenny were also mentally and physically drained by her second miscarriage. For them, Scott’s attempt at the Application Trail FKT was a way for them to try to escape and reconnect with themselves.

In addition, I am sure I will just share some shorter things that might be of interest or making me think from time to time.  \n<br>\nI was actually looking back at some of my earlier posts on this site the other day, and one post called \"<a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2014/11/03/starting-from-the.html\">Going back to the beginning</a>\" caught my attention. There is a sentence in there that probably sums up what this blog has been and might be for eternity.\n<br>\n>I am blogging as a way to share interesting stories and thoughts.\n<br>\n\n### Ok, ok, I get all of that but why Up North!\n\nI am sure at the time I was thinking about it I had a much better reason. However, it really came down to I wanted a change and something simple. I live in what some call the Bold North or that is how it was advertised during the Superbowl and it has kind of stuck around for some. Also, when I think of Up North, I think of someone spending time outside and that my friend is something I enjoy. After I <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/02/09/back-to-running.html\">refound my love of running</a> I try to get outside almost daily now as it is almost like therapy. In addition, over this past year, I have made it a priority to explore more of the parks and trails around my city as I have regretted such a thing in my past life.\n<br>\nSum all of that up and the name just stuck for me as it meant something.\n<br>\nFor those of you that have been with me for a while or if you are new here I am thankful no matter what. I hope everyone sticks around and as always leave me a comment if you have any suggestions, questions, or just want to drop me a note.\n",

In fact, I am currently writing this while flying back to the US and probably won't spend a lot of time editing it or polishing it up. Just some random observations.</i></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>People are always worried about how connected they are and how much they are doing things on their phones or devices in the US. My wife and I are included in this as we try to model good behavior of device usage at home and try not to be too dependent on it so we can be present for our kids. However, using my phone as a camera I knowingly pull it out of my pocket quite a bit so I can snap a picture of the kids or a beautiful landscape. I always feel I could do better here but after traveling for the past week I have started to realize our problem might not be as bad as we all think it is.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":51123065,\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/3b6ff5c1e4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-51123065\"/><figcaption>Photo credit <a href=\"https://travelsovertoys.com/\">Travels Over Toys</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have spent the last week in China where I was both in Shanghai and Beijing. Below are a couple of observations I have noticed about device usage.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Walking in the Streets</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While in China it didn’t stop me from running, even though my wife and mom thought I shouldn’t be out early in the morning running the streets of China. Not only from a safety perspective but air pollution as well. Don’t worry I am safely on a plane back to the US so all is well. On my first morning running, I noticed there was relatively no one out in the streets but it was bright enough outside to be 8 am back home. On that first day, 5 people almost walked right into me as they were deeply in thought of what was on their screen and facing down. Remember I was running and not being super stealthy trying to sneak up on anyone so they for sure had to have heard my feet hitting the brick pavement. You would think as that noise came closer to them they might consider looking up. However, not only did they not look up even when I was right next to them, they were just drifting along with their nose to the screen.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Eating Lunch</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Eating lunch with my co-workers the first day I remember glancing around the restaurant and everyone at every other table had their phones out and looking down. I won't say we don't do that in the US but it seemed like a lot more than where I live. Now some of this could just be Shanghai is a bigger city than the Minneapolis area and if I lived in a downtown setting I might notice this more often. That might be some of it but I am not 100% sure that is the whole reason as I have done my fair share of traveling in the US as well.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>My Take</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Whereas people in the US keep trying to make conscious efforts to stay away from their phones, China seems to be doing the opposite. The restaurant I was talking about earlier where everyone was on their phone some of it made more sense as I traveled more. You see in China even though you go to a restaurant and sit down, most of the time you end up ordering from your phone (thinking face). Yep, you heard that right, the people sitting at the tables and planning on eating it there ALL order and ALL pay by their phone. I can see some benefits on the payment side of things as you don't have to worry about them taking your credit card or dealing with cash. Also, I would assume a receipt would be instantly on your phone if you needed it for your records or business purposes. However, this whole situation is just another way to keep people engaged on their phone and not put them down.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In talking with a colleague on a different night, she explained that now she doesn't even carry cash or bank cards but just always keeps her phone on her. It sounds like everything is almost done by phones for them and that could be a major reason everyone seemed to be looking down. If you are in the habit of using it all the time for everything then it just becomes so ingrained in your daily life that you probably don’t even think about not looking at it when you are with others or completely alone walking the streets. It is a mere lifeline at this point in their culture as everything is becoming connected (kind of sounds like the Feed in the <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/05/14/breach-by-eliot.html\">Analog Series</a> of books ?).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":51123064,\"align\":\"center\",\"width\":557,\"height\":372} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/cb4a93c5bb.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-51123064\" width=\"557\" height=\"372\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>There could be some benefits here</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Even though this all sounds bad, I actually can’t believe how far along they have come technology wise. My last visit to China was 4 years ago and I still remember watching most people pay by cash or credit/bank cards. However, this time almost everything is digital and I was for sure an outsider paying by cash and credit card. They had to dust off the machine in the corner and even then a handwritten receipt was given to me as they didn't have a printer around. This is because most people in China just got it on their phones.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Even when traveling in Germany last year I found it interesting that they bring the payment terminal to your table and you watch them run your credit card. Those payment terminals needed to be connected in some fashion so they didn’t have to walk my card back to the main terminal. However, what I was noticing in China would be taking it one more notch up. They merely had a QR code somewhere on the table that you could scan and send the payment to if you didn’t already order from the phone.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As much as I don’t want to be so tied to my phone as I truly like putting it down once in a while. I would welcome having more things go digital like payments and receipts. I too do not like carrying my wallet around with lots of other stuff in it if I can avoid it. I can see that more things will be done by phone which will also require a lot more focus and discipline for myself to make sure it doesn't become the norm of always being on my phone. I want to be present and in the moment with my kids and not always be looking down at my phone. I do welcome this challenge as I really can see benefits.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><i><b>What do you think? Would having more things go digital be good or would you fear you would be tied even more to technology and it could bring bad habits along the way?</b></i></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Not to jump too far to my conclusion but this is another great book by Eliot and I really enjoy how his books can stand by themselves but are also tied together to make a great series.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":51123044,\"align\":\"center\",\"width\":333,\"height\":500,\"linkDestination\":\"custom\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Breach-Analog-Novel-Book-3-ebook/dp/B07HHY3MRM/?tag=stthink-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/aa568e2ada.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-51123044\" width=\"333\" height=\"500\"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"fontSize\":\"small\"} -->\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><em>I was lucky enough to get an advanced copy to read but as I really do enjoy Eliot's writing I bought the Kindle and Audiobook version too in order to add to my growing collections of great books.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For the final story in the analog novels, Eliot further weaves the prior books of this series together by bringing back prior characters that some may have forgotten. This time, however, the people who long ago were manipulating the feed are the only ones capable of saving it as an activist group is trying to destroy the credibility and power it possesses.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A stranger in hiding discovers that this group of powerful people wants to destroy the feed and she knows she needs to do something about it.  The stranger has been in hiding for so long trying to forget about the missteps of her past life knows that what is being discussed could hurt those that she was close to. She must decide if it is worth it to come out of hiding to help her friends that she abandoned long ago. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Prior to this Emily, who had manipulated a backdoor to the feed had no thought of going back and reconnecting with her past friends and acquaintances but after stumbling upon this plot to hurt those people she knew she couldn't sit idle.  As she weaves her way back into the lives of those she abandoned she reflects on her upbringing and what brought her to where she is today.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Honestly, I could go on and on about the story but I think you should pick up a copy yourself to read as I don't want to spoil anything that might give away how it ends.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Attention to <g class=\"gr_ gr_26 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"26\" data-gr-id=\"26\">detail</g></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As always, Eliot does great with the details. This is one of the many reasons I really enjoy reading his books. He writes in a way that paints a vivid picture of what the character is seeing, hearing and feeling as they go about the story. All of that further adds to the story as you feel you are part of the action.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Not to mention he does a great job drawing from current events and issues in the world today to bring this story that much closer to the very near future. Topics around student loans, schools effectiveness, and of course politics on a global scale just to name a few. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This story was tightly woven into the other two books of the Analog series by the characters, but Eliot also made sure the books could be read by themselves. Keep your eyes out for the easter eggs that he drops into the stories when he might reference other characters or places from other books he has written. I am sure I didn't catch them all but when I find something referencing a different book (not part of this series) it does put a smile on my face. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As with almost all of Eliot's books, I really enjoy the quotes and insights that are sprinkled about. In the various types of books I read, I don't normally pull out motivation from fiction books.  However, I am thinking Eliot does this on purpose as the character is normally trying to motivate themselves or others but the same statements can be used in everyday life. One that stuck out for me in this story is below.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:pullquote {\"className\":\"is-style-default\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote is-style-default\"><blockquote><p>Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.</p></blockquote></figure>\n<!-- /wp:pullquote -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you are looking for a good book to read while enjoying the warmer summer months I would definitely suggest picking up this book as it will keep you wanting more. Not to mention if you have not read any of the books in this series I would suggest starting from the beginning as you can't go wrong.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I really do enjoy Eliot's books and his style of writing as you can tell. I can't wait to see what is up next for him as he continues to produce great work.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

I will be home for 2 weeks then a vacation with the whole family where we will be traveling for about a week. Once I get back from that I will have a weekend with the family before boarding a plane again. That time, however, will be an international trip which always adds to some travel complexities.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/57633f4393.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I typically don't mind traveling except that I have to be away from my family and potentially miss activities of theirs. However, what makes things worse is the pending appointments of flight departures. The hurry up and wait of it all is really nothing special. I am sure I was annoyed with it when I was fresh out of college traveling but maybe I didn’t care as much now. Or it might have been because I was so much younger and didn't have anything else going on.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What makes that even worse is when you have a flight later in the day and your whole day gets sucked into making sure you can leave on time. Or even worse then you feel you can't do anything all day as you want to make sure you leave at the optimal time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are too many variables when flying that sometimes suck the enjoyment out of air traveling. Let’s start from the top and work through a couple of items that make the pending appointment of air travel less fun.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Getting to the Airport</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Travel times, yep you know what I am talking about is there traffic and if so how bad is it?

If I drive, how long will it take me to park and get to the airport?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/4a4ceaf2af.gif\" width=\"600\" height=\"404\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><b>Security Line</b></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>How early should I really arrive?

Should I still go at the same time because remember that time the switch it to later and then the plane came in early and it wasn't as long as they said. How delayed do you think it will be? Will I make my connection? When will I get to my destination? Do you think the flight will be canceled? If so, how do I rebook or get a new flight?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/feb573bc16.gif\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You see all of those questions that run through your head and then you have to calculate the time back to your starting point of leaving the house. Not to mention if you have a flight later in the day you keep thinking about it and wondering if the time you planned to leave for the airport is right or if you should go earlier.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then after you think you have answered all of your questions for airplane travel, you realize you haven't consulted the <i><b>Weather</b></i>! Well, that throws a wrench into everything and you have to start at the top again to see how that might affect what you already decided on ideal departure.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/7cf496010d.gif\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><b>This seems out of place</b></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well hope you enjoyed these random thoughts while I sit in the airport for a 3 hr delayed flight that was supposed to leave at 8:30 pm but we are now not leaving till 11:30 pm and arriving around 2:30 am local time.

However, before I jump into my own thoughts I really think you should watch the video as he brings up some really good points on being Rich vs being Poor.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ROfBLx6bLZI\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n<h3>Recap</h3>\n\n<p>For a little recap, in case you didn’t watch the video but I really think you should, Casey boils it down to everyone has <strong><em>Life Problems</em></strong> which consist of Happiness, Love, Fulfillment, and Purpose (at a minimum). However, if you are poor on top of those problems you have the big gorilla which is <strong><em>Money Problems</em></strong> because you don’t know where you are going to live, how to put food on the table, take care of yourself when you are sick, or maybe even not sure how to get to your job without proper transportation.</p>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/bfdfb325c4.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you are like me, you are going to look at that list and agree with him that it is kind of straightforward. Poorer people are worried so much about money problems that when rich people say they can’t find their purpose in life and that money can’t solve their problems, we all jump off the rails because money would solve our problems. <br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>So let's take this one step further now….</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are some people that are in-between this simple concept of <strong><em>Money</em></strong> and <strong><em>Life</em></strong> problems. In fact, most people probably fall in the middle of this easy example. I would take a guess that most of us think we have some sort of Money problems.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If we take a closer look at what we think are our money problems (or think we are poor), are we really just spending above our means. We feel we need a bigger house or extra vacations. Where in reality if we cut those out we could begin to look closer at those Life problems.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the video, the article that Casey references is from the NY Times and titled <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/21/magazine/elite-professionals-jobs-happiness.html\">America’s Professional Elite: Wealthy, Successful, and Miserable</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cduhigg\">Charles Duhig (@cduhigg)</a>. One part of the article that jumped out at me was a quote from the guy who made $1.2M a year and felt defeated in life said he was locked into a lifestyle that made cutting his pay impossible.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>He had received an offer at a start-up, and he would have loved to take it, but it paid half as much, and he felt locked into a lifestyle that made this pay cut impossible. “My wife laughed when I told her about it,” he said.</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That right there is the true problem of what we all feel when we have moved out of the Poor category (i.e., basic needs being taken care of), we get locked into a new version of ourselves that moving backward would feel like we failed. So our new version of poor keeps increasing with us. I am guessing most people could probably take a different job and still not be <strong><u>poor</u></strong> assuming they could get their spending and priorities in order of what is important. That is work that not everyone is willing to take and it is also something that does not change overnight. Not many people want to downsize their house or give up that yearly trip to Disney with the kids.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Over the past years, I have read a lot of articles from Personal Finance and Minimalist bloggers and the thing that always sticks out to me is the underlying topic of living true to your priorities. Some of that is figuring out what your “basic needs” or “minimum needs” are so then you can really figure out if changes can be made in your job/career to help you really tackle Life Problems that we all face. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>My thoughts / Take Aways</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I am not immune to this thing and it is something I always struggle with as I am sure most people do. My basic needs have been met so at the simplest form I really shouldn’t have any Money Problems. Moving past that, I boil it down to the two resources I have at my disposal in order to make my Life Problems either manageable or fixed. <strong>Time and Money</strong><br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Time and money are both resources at our disposal which is really all that is needed for most problems in our lives and possibly the world. The hard part is to figure out how to balance both of them in order to get an optimal outcome for yourself. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Note I said optimal outcome, as there is not always a perfect balance of having tons of money and tons of free time.</em><br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Each of these resources is needed for prioritizing things that are important to us. For example, if you continue to upgrade your lifestyle by buying the newest gadgets, bigger houses, and fancier cars because you feel it is the most important thing to do you might find yourself in a situation of having no way out. Similar to the guy in the story from the NY Times. All of your resources are being used to tackle a lifestyle you want to achieve and I am guessing that lifestyle gives you less time and money to find love, meaning, and happiness.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

However, if you have read other philosophies on decluttering or are 80% there, this book might not be for you then.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":51122732,\"align\":\"center\",\"width\":768,\"height\":512,\"linkDestination\":\"custom\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><a href=\" https://www.amazon.com/Minimalist-Home-Room-Room-Decluttered/dp/1601427999/?tag=stthink-20 \" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/0f0bd7da91.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-51122732\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>The Book</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Each part of the book is comprised of topics broken down into specific rooms to tackle and ideas that go along with it. Specifically, some of the chapters were around decluttering the following rooms:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Living Room and Family Room</li><li>Bedrooms and Guest Rooms</li><li>CLosets and Mudroom</li><li>Bathrooms and Laundry Room</li><li>Kitchen and Dining Room</li><li>Home Office</li><li>Storage, Hobby, and Toy Rooms</li><li>Garage and Yard</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The book did a good job of having a mix of tactical informing to get started, personal stories from Joshua, and then personal stories of others. I think each complimented the other and really enforced to the reader that you are not in this alone. There are people out there right now reading this ready to take the same steps as you as well as people like you who walked these same steps and here is their story, and mine.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In addition to the great steps and antidotes throughout the book, I really enjoyed the quick quotes sprinkled throughout. They are perfect to write down as a reminder of why you might be taking this journey.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Minimalism isn’t about removing things you love. It’s about removing the things that distract you from the things you love.</p><cite>Joshua Becker – The Minimalist Home<br></cite></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is one thing I don’t remember from his other books and he called it a minimalism dividend. In short form, it is really just the savings or benefits you would get due to the fact you now have less stuff to take care of (e.g., <g class=\"gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"7\" data-gr-id=\"7\">maintenance</g> cost of items). There honestly <g class=\"gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"8\" data-gr-id=\"8\">is</g> so many benefits to living a more decluttered life and if you haven’t started your journey it could be hard to grasp. That is where this book does a good job of pointing out many of the benefits you could gain by reducing clutter instead of just organizing it nicely in a closet or storage facility.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>My own decluttering thoughts</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Never organize what you can discard.</p><cite> Joshua Becker – The Minimalist Home </cite></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>From a personal perspective, that was one of the biggest things I learned through my decluttering process. I think back at all the time my wife and I were just trying to move things around in our house in order to be <strong><em>organized</em></strong>. Fast forward 10 years, with the knowledge we know now and we really just needed to get rid of stuff. I can’t even count the number of times we commented to each other that all we felt like we did was organize and move stuff around during our free weekends.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>ONLY Downside</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The only downside to this book for me is that I have read a lot of what Joshua Becker has written in book form (e.g., <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/05/31/the-more-of.html\">The More <g class=\"gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del\" id=\"5\" data-gr-id=\"5\">of</g> Less</a>), stories from his blog <a href=\"https://www.becomingminimalist.com/\">Becoming Minimalist</a>, in addition to taking his <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Uncluttered  (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://uncluttered.samcart.com/referral/kwVBIyfN/KLDewKhkPXB2B00D\" target=\"_blank\">Uncluttered</a>course. So from that token, nothing in the book was new to me and most of his personal stories were the same ones that I had heard before. That is why I said at the beginning if you are far along on a path to decluttering this book might not be right for you as it probably won’t be anything groundbreaking to get you to 100%.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Parting thoughts<br></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Even though I have followed Joshua Becker for some time, one of the best parts of this book is to hear other people's stories. Since the other stuff was not new, I enjoyed all of the other stories and hearing how other people have approached it and then after they completed what it means to them today. As I said before if you are looking to declutter your house and need somewhere to start I would definitely pick up this book as it really does a good job giving you a room-by-room guide to getting you started. If anything, I feel Joshua Becker does a great job in this area anyway so I would suggest you check out his blog (<a href=\"https://www.becomingminimalist.com/\">Becoming Minimalist</a>).<br><br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

So meet Lainey Lou the Miniature Petite Golden Doodle.</p>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/c2842a9d82.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"599\" alt=\"\" />\n*Lainey at 8 months old (March 2019)*\n\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/b4e0d00f43.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\" />\n*Lainey at 2 months old (September 2018)*\n\n<i>As you can see she is not as petite as she was when we first got her :) .\n\nEveryone in the family loves her to death even though we miss our old pets. This has oddly enough been a little bit of an adjustment as we really did take advantage of a pet free lifestyle over the summer. Now that everything has changed, it is a good change but we are back to moring upfront planning to make sure Lainey can either come with us or has another place to stay.</p>\n\n<p>As I continue into this next year, a new word that keeps popping up in my head is <b>Embrace</b>. It builds upon last year as I want to embrace those things that my family and I enjoy and continue to cut out other areas that do not bring us joy. This not only goes for personal things but work related stuff as well, I know there is time to focus at work but also I want to start embracing the opportunities that are placed before me instead of always trying to run to or think about the next shiny object.\n\nIf I am true to myself in this upcoming year I know this will be a challenge to keep but I am really up for it as it has been on my mind for a while.\n\nPreviously: <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/03/24/thirtyfive.html\">35</a>, <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2017/03/24/thirtysix.html\">36</a>, <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2018/03/24/thirtyseven.html\">37</a> ..\n",

				"content_text": "\n<p>I have been at a standstill for the last three months since I had posted a hand full of new articles. As the days clicked by I finally decided I should really think about it as I would put pressure on myself to push publish but ultimately nothing ever happened.</p>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/6e45bb9f83.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n<p><em>Now before I get too far along this isn't one of those I was too busy or I forgot about posting for the last couple of months. I will say there has been too much on my mind about the content to post and not enough time to finish it out.</em>﻿</p>\n\n<p>I was excited to post the follow-ups for <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2018/11/05/media-consumption.html\">Media Consumption</a> and the <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2018/11/29/floodgates-of-unnecessary.html\">Floodgates of Unnecessary Purchases</a> as I had some more thoughts on each of those subjects. In fact, right now I have 5 posts ready to publish today if I wanted to but where I keep getting caught up is do I really want to publish them on this site or do I want to release them if/when I change this site name in the upcoming days... weeks... months... years... It seems like I keep thinking of changing it up and that keeps making me push out my timeline of posting stuff I already have done.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Over Thinking Might be the Problem</h3>\n\n<p>I am not worried about the change in general but I am wrestling in my mind with what this site should be or what the new site should become. That is where I hit my standstill. Here is some of what keeps going through my head:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>For the best results shouldn't I publish similar types of material and not be all over the place?</li><li>My longer form articles are around finance, minimalism, habits, or working on focusing, so I should probably only publish that type of material.</li><li>If I start a new site should I only write about those things there and let the other stuff just fade out into the Interwebs.</li><li>I could run two different types of blogs one for more specific content and then one of other random stuff?</li></ul>\n\n<h3>So what should I do?</h3>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/f076710431.jpg\" width=\"322\" height=\"373\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>I was going to just pose this as a question to anyone reading if you have been in a similar situation or what other questions would you ask me? However, as I thought of what to title this random post I realized the word Standstill came to mind. It seemed fitting because instead of publishing what I write, I have just been at a standstill. No new site, and no new posts.</p>\n\n<h3>Looking back and moving forward</h3>\n\n<p>At this moment, I realize that I need to pull back from trying to craft the articles that might do well and get shared across all of social media. In my current situation I just like writing about things I see, stuff that is making me think, or interesting stuff I find online. This is more of a creative outlet that was never started with optimizing my audience or more specifically making money. Looking back I didn't have a direction of where I wanted to take this it was just a place to share things. </p>\n\n<p>Over the last two years, I realized I had lost that as I kept thinking I should switch my topics/publishing style to match some of the people I follow that are super successful. That is them and that is not me nor at this time do I really want it to be me. I don't want to be bound by what I post about as it would be forcing me to pretend in a way. I know it could be beneficial in the long term if I would just <b>niche down</b> but at this time that is not going to happen but I am sure common themes will be present in my posts.</p>\n\n<p>Hope you stick with me as the future is unknown 😉</p>\n",

The list of what that decision might have been or could be a number of different things.  For example, your job, family, friends, or finances to name a few common ones.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\"You're always only one decision away from a totally different life\"</p><cite>unknown</cite></blockquote>\n\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/44858eeb59.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>I really like that quote as it does ring true for myself and probably many of you. Well, at least the thought that a decision we made previously might have led us down a different path which then causes us to stop and think. However, other times it is something small that came and went. In fact, every day you are faced with some sort of decision that will lead you to the path you are today and not to the path you maybe could be on.</p>\n\n<p>One of the reasons I like that quote above is circling back to the life you want. You might think things haven’t turned out like you had hoped it would or you wish you would have done something different in your past. I am as guilty as the next person and I keep going back to things I maybe should have done or shouldn't have done. I am trying to get away from that as it isn't really healthy as you never really know what would have happened because you might have still chosen a different path again and been worse off.</p>\n\n<h3>Small Steps Forward</h3>\n\n<p>If you think about that quote again and think of it as making life choices to move towards a goal you would like. What is a small step you could take to move yourself to where you would like to be? You just need to start changing habits or creating habits that will move you to your life goal. That is the best place to start instead of thinking about what you might have missed out on because of the choices you made.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><i>While writing this I was reminded of a video Anthony Ongaro at <a href=\"https://www.breakthetwitch.com/\">Break the Twitch</a> published which ties in nicely with this topic and is called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WX81NSRVV5U\">One Small Change That Creates Massive Results</a>. Check it out and follow his work for more great nuggets of information.</i></pre>\n\n<h3>How has it worked for me?</h3>\n\n<p>For me personally, I tried to do this last year and I will say for 9 months of this year I failed at the approach of small steps as I was taking too many small steps in too many different areas of my life which resulted in ZERO changes. However, about 2 months ago I spent some time really thinking about what I wanted my future to look like. Not necessarily the big dream future as I have always tried to think about it previously but just looking out a couple months to a year for things like family vacations, job, and fitness.</p>\n\n<h3>Second attempt</h3>\n\n<p>Fitness and vacation goals were easy to think about but the execution in those required focus on a day in and day out basis. This is where breaking those things down into little bits I could tackle has really paid dividends. Really it was making small decisions of prioritizing if I wanted to move to my goals of vacation and fitness or put my resources (time/money) into something else.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/6e5e350640.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" />\n*It takes small steps to reach the top or your goal. Take your time step by step.*\n\n<p>For careers, this is a more difficult task as it isn't something that can be changed instantly as you are more than likely not going to quit your job today and hope for the best. For me this probably too a lot more energy thinking about as I know what I am doing today isn’t necessarily what I want to be doing in 5-10 years from now. So instead of just trying to shoot for the stars now, I had to think about what is either holding me in my current role or preventing me from getting into another role or a similar role at another company. The answer was easier than I thought but one that is oftentimes hard to feel like you can accomplish… Money and Experience!</p>\n\n\n<p>This is where starting to take small steps today like saving more money as changes in careers might have you moving from a higher salary to a lower one initially. So making sure you can have more in the bank and in turn live off less will help make that move more achievable when the opportunity presents itself.</p>\n\n<p>Gaining more experience can be more challenging depending on if you are changing careers or just wanting a similar role at another company. Either way, you probably need to get more experience or else you would already be in that new role. In both cases this can come from volunteering, experimenting on your own time, or trying to see if you can gain more skills for your next role in your current role.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p>As you can see from a career standpoint, it is definitely a bigger hill to climb but the process of taking small steps towards and the end goal of what you want is how you have to ultimately start it.</p>\n\n<h3>Final thoughts</h3>\n\n<p>What keeps me moving is making sure I make decisions based on what I value or believe in as well as trying to stay positive. Knowing whatever decision I make I will own and do my best to keep the ball moving towards my goal based on my values. I know if I do that I will less likely keep wondering <b>what if </b>as I will have better reasons and purpose behind the path I choose.</p>\n",

It started with the question of how can I pack most efficiently as I didn’t want to check baggage through since I wanted to be somewhat mobile on the weekend. So as I was looking over my typical packing, which is normally pretty minimal as for a week travel in the US I use my <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Kelty-22632716BK-Versant-Duffel-Bag/dp/B015GXULLI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=stthink-20\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kelty Versant Duffel</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":51122702,\"align\":\"center\",\"width\":576,\"height\":432} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/dfc2c87ef8.jpg\" alt=\"Kelty Versant Duffel\" class=\"wp-image-51122702\" width=\"576\" height=\"432\"/><figcaption>I even pack my laptop in this bag on most trips in the US I take for work. Remember I love to run so there is running gear in there too! </figcaption></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, knowing I was going to be gone longer and over the weekend, I knew I would use a little bigger bag but really wanted to try to squeeze everything into a small carry-on suitcase order to make travel from hotel to hotel much easier. So I decided to update my list a little bit before I knew it I was looking at my things and thinking there was probably something better than I could buy instead of taking similar items that I currently own.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>The Problem Started Brewing</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While packing my clothes I got this idea that if I bought some pants that would be comfortable enough to wear walking around but still look nice enough to wear to work a couple days over the trip that would be money worthwhile. So what did I do, what everyone does when they want something by heading to Amazon. However, it didn’t stop there…</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I wanted to work out so I was going to take some running shoes, however, the ones I had wouldn’t work for casual at work and running as they are bright yellow and pretty worn at this point. Speaking of shoes though, maybe I should just get some new casual / dress shoes so I might not have to bring my actual dress shoes. Don’t you think some new socks are in order too? Also, I didn’t want to take my two phones along (long story), so I needed to buy a new phone workout band for the time I was away. Finally, I needed a different phone charger as the long cord just wouldn’t cut it as I didn’t want all that excess cord in my pocket when it was charging on the go. Before I knew it I had a list of “<b>Needs</b>” that probably totaled more than $400 and in 2 days boxes started showing up from Amazon.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You see what just happened there, it was so easy for my mind to justify purchasing and elevated things from a “<b>Want</b>” to a “<b>Need</b>” prior to my work trip. Once I had my mindset on packing light, I opened the floodgates of unnecessary purchases and I ended up with things I typically wouldn’t have bought myself till it was absolutely necessary.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Backpedaling to my Frugal Self</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the end, I came to my senses before it was too late and started to backpedal on what was really a need for this trip. Thankfully all of the items I had purchased had free returns. I did still end up keeping some of them and I feel good about it to this day as I know I have used them every week since.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":51122701,\"align\":\"center\",\"width\":576,\"height\":768} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/b188c5c1ad.jpg\" alt=\"Kölner Dom - Cologne Cathedral, Germany\" class=\"wp-image-51122701\" width=\"576\" height=\"768\"/><figcaption>Walking down the steep steps of the Cologne Cathedral!</figcaption></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"fontSize\":\"small\"} -->\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><i>Ok, two more plugs as I am still running in those <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GU9N8HQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=stthink-20\">Asics shoes</a> above and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H9ME25G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=stthink-20\">prAna pants</a> are amazing too.

Note there wasn’t even a wall between these two rooms. Not to mention, some hotels I have stayed at over the past year even have my name on it asking me to log into all my other accounts almost like it is calling me :)</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/870aaf52f4.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"332\" alt=\"\" />\n*Who needs two TVs this close together? NO ONE!*\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So what do I do instead of watching TV? Typically that is when I would read the latest Blog posts of people I regularly follow, listen to a Podcast or an Audiobook, or sometimes I will just lay in bed or sit on the couch and actually read a book. I typically don’t “read” books as often as I am listening to books but I still do find time to just sit and read books from time to time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>What types of Media do you Consume</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All of this other media consumption that I would typically say is better than watching hours of TV or spending hours browsing social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) I am now wondering if it should be cut back on as well. I have realized that I sometimes get so consumed in them that before I know it I have accomplished nothing else on my long list of things I would like to accomplish like writing (on this blog is a good point), creating something new, running (yes I am weird like that), or even calling a friend.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Everyone is always saying we spend so much time on Social Media and watching TV shows or movies online. However, how much time do we spend consuming other media, and is that starting to move towards an area of concern? I could easily make the argument that it is better than other things but it also is taking away from me doing something else I enjoy. I don’t have a good answer on that one but since it has crossed my mind I am definitely going to look closer and possibly keep track of how much time in a given week I spend on these other forms of information consumption.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Now it is your turn, do you think you over consume other types of media?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>In full disclosure, this post has been written since April and I keep coming back to it as I am not sure if I was ready to hit publish. I have added some parts here and there over the months leading up to when I actually hit publish but I finally decided to just hit publish and I am sure I will have more on this topic at a later point in time.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

The main character from the previous book, Dag, is living with Diana and he is no longer working as a lobbyist and spends his days coloring. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This story is from Diana's viewpoint, who is working as a freelance spy now that she has left the CIA. A subtle underlying story of the book is how Diana is trying to figure out how to avoid second-guessing herself, putting trust in others, all while battling mentors and others from her past. While she is dealing with her own internal struggles, she needs to stay sharp in order to put a stop to others taking over one of the world's most important resources.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Attention to <g class=\"gr_ gr_26 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"26\" data-gr-id=\"26\">detail</g></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"left\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">The one thing I have really enjoyed about this series is how it talks about the feed but never does Eliot really describe how the feed is connected to us or what it really is. I think it is great to leave that abstract out as we each have our own thoughts and images of what that might actually look like. Also based on how the characters in the book use/talk about the feed you continue to create in your mind what that looks like.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the things I appreciate about Eliot's books is the realistic characters, their struggles, and overall attention to detail. Even though the book is written in a near-future time, he used tools at his disposal to map/chart out what the world would have looked like and the paths the characters could have taken.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, as with all of Eliot's books there are hidden Easter Eggs for you to find where he may reference other books he has written. It always brings a smile to my face as I know it isn't always easy to tie books from different series together but a lot of authors do it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you are looking for a good book to read as the colder months are approaching I would definitely pick this book up as it really grabs your attention from the first page and keeps you wanting more.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally, Eliot has another book in this series that is schedule to be released in May 2019 titled \"<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Breach-Analog-Novel-Eliot-Peper/dp/1542044596/?tag=stthink-20\" rel=\"nofollow\">Breach</a>\" that I for one am excited to see what is next.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

As always, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/trippandtyler\">Tripp and Tyler</a> have done it again by giving everyone a glips into how it sometimes goes down.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {\"url\":\"[youtu.be/0FnltJ3GY...](https://youtu.be/0FnltJ3GYus)\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n[youtu.be/0FnltJ3GY...](https://youtu.be/0FnltJ3GYus)\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>My Thoughts</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have to admit as much as I enjoyed the video, I can't remember the last time I had rental car issues.&nbsp; However, since travel frequently most companies have my profile on file that allows me to walk up and grab a car and drive away. Avoiding that discussion with a sales agent trying to get me to buy more. I remember when that wasn't the case and I felt they were trying to sell me every part of the car and all I got was the shell. I just remember being confused what was really included in the quote when I ordered the car.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Airlines are in this game as well but to varying degrees&nbsp;based on the airline, you travel. It seems more airlines are going in this direction as well and it is really disappointing but a the same time I get what they are trying to do. They are trying to make people feel they are getting a great price at the time of purchase only to find out it didn't include everything. The worst part is all of these \"fees\" really add up for airlines and more than likely going to the <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/2018/02/airlines-profit-comes-when-you-pay-baggage-and-change-fees/\">bottom line</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is very common these days that if you are not a regular flyer or have a credit card for the airline you are flying you&nbsp;more than likely will have to pay baggage fees. Some airlines are now going to start charging customers for full size carry on's depending on the ticket you purchase (<em>Thanks&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.united.com/ual/en/us/fly/travel/baggage/carry-on.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">United!</a></em>) Then, of course, there have been the odd one from a while back where one airline was charging people to use the bathroom. Yes, the Bathroom. I believe that didn't stick around but you can see that you need to be careful when booking travel and make sure you know what you bought.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What are your thoughts? Do you think companies should just give you one flat cost and have everything included? Or should they give you a base price and then have you pay for upgrades / additional services.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

You will quickly figure out that the main character Dag Calhoon, a lobbyist representing high-powered tech and energy executives, starts questioning the world he has been helping create. In this world, every person has a \"feed\" (like social media) that is always in people's minds and is integral to how the world works. As the story evolves, Dag stumbles upon a group of activists that have hijacked people's feeds in order to sway public options and global markets. He eventually is faced with big decisions as he tries to figure out what is right/wrong and whom to trust.\n\nI would say Eliot has done a good job in changing the types of books I have been custom to over the past couple of years. Where three years ago I would have said I read more Mystery or Action-Adventure and typically would have stayed away from Sci-fi type books. This book (like some of his others) is not what I would consider your typical Sci-fi books but more \"near-term sci-fi\" as it seems more within reach in the next decade.\n\n<h3>**The Future feels closer than you think these days**</h3><p>\nEven though this is a future-looking book, with everything in the news these days around political, environmental, and social media control issues it almost seems closer than you think. This book has them all and intertwines them into a great page-turning novel.  As always with Eliot's books, this is a very fast-paced story with a lot of twists and turns to make you really think. Not to mention the precision of detail he puts into describing the situations, buildings, food, and drinks that paints a perfect picture of what you should be seeing. Finally, I appreciated the short chapters as I always find myself with interrupting children when finally find time to sit down and read.\n\nI really can't recommend this book enough and as always don't want to give too much of it away. So I would suggest you go <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bandwidth-Analog-Novel-Eliot-Peper/dp/1503954420/?tag=stthink-20\" rel=\"nofollow\">reserve a copy</a>\n\nTo make sure you don't miss out on his next books and sequel to Bandwith titled Borderless, be sure to follow him on Twitter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/eliotpeper\">@EliotPeper</a>) and subscribe to his newsletter from his website (<a href=\"http://www.eliotpeper.com/\">http://www.eliotpeper.com/</a>).\n<p>\n<em>As I mentioned I have read some of Eliot's books before and wrote about them so if you are interested </em>to check<em> out some of his other books go for it as you won't be disappointed!  Here are a couple: </em><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2017/06/23/true-blue-a.html\">True Blue (A Short Story)</a>, <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/08/03/neon-fever-dream.html\">Neon Fever Dream</a>, <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2015/03/18/uncommon-stock-power.html\">Uncommon Stock: Power Play</a> and <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2015/08/05/uncommon-stock-exit.html\">Uncommon Stock: Exit Strategy</a>.\n",

				"content_text": "Year 2 has come and gone… As I am excited to see another year of people using the Blogging Meetup, I hold back a little bit as I know I have been very distanced from it in the last year as I was working to prioritize various extra projects in my life last year.\n<h4><b>Look back at Year 2</b></h4>\nMy thoughts haven’t changed though as I really enjoy this little side project and I intend to keep it around. In fact, as of today, we have 450 people registered on the site. That is up 67 from last year where we had 383 users on the site. Maybe when we hit 500 we should have an online party :)! Now only because I am a numbers guru I want to show you the stats of the last two years by month. As you can see it is trending down and in about August last year it started declining faster. In fact, February this year looks like it will only be about half of last year.\n\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/c3365db595.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"265\" alt=\"\" />  \n\n<h4><b>Peeling back the Numbers</b></h4>\nI didn’t need to dig into the site stats to produce the chart above as I already had an idea of what the results were going to be. If you have looked at the site a couple of times in the last months it is mostly the same handful of people posting over and over. Not that there is nothing wrong with that as I am glad people are using it as established and it seems like there is another handful of users that look at the site on a daily basis. However, I still find it troubling that there is less engagement on the site than I hoped there would have been. Though for that problem of engagement, I hold myself accountable for a good portion of the blame as I know that there need to be more “things” (e.g., prompts, events, topic discussions) or things to get people engaged in the site. In fact, over the past year, I slowly had forgotten to keep up with the Like, Follow, Share Monday prompts. I think that generated good engagement for readers and hopefully gave some bloggers a nice bump in stats are people were going to check out their site.\n\nOn the positive side of things, I was happy to finally finish the <a href=\"https://bloggingmeetup.com/memberposts/\">Members post page</a> which is really just an RSS feed from all members sites. However, on the flip side, I am not sure if people have found it useful or worthwhile. Some of that is I am not able to get any stats from it so unsure if links are being clicked on or not.\n<h4><b>Next Steps</b></h4>\nSo that brings me to today where I have been neglecting this site and trying to figure out what to do next. I would love to get feedback from anyone on what they think should be done with this site. Nothing is a bad idea as I still think a Blogging Community makes sense but maybe this implementation/version of it isn’t working anymore. Maybe the site needs to be more like a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/\">BuddyPress</a> that can be more conversational, or forum-based like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-discussion-board/\">Discussion Board</a>, or maybe even just a big <a href=\"https://slack.com/\">Slack</a> group.\n\nIn the short term, however, I am going to figure out a way to kick off the like follow share again but maybe I will try to incorporate it with the RSS feeds from members' sites in order to get people looking at something that is newly posted. Over the next several months I am going to really take a hard look at the Blogging Meetup and see where this site should be taken. I am going to hope for feedback from the community as I don’t want to just make this decision alone.\n<h4>Summary</h4>\nYear two was still a good year for the Blogging Meetup as people were still using the site as it was originally intended. However, during the beginning of year 3, it is time to figure out what the next chapter of this site is going to look like to make sure it is still meaningful to everyone going forward.\n\n<i><b>What do you think the next year of the Blogging Meetup should look like?

She was the second of our \"kids\", and she has lived in Michigan (where we got her from), Illinois and Minnesota. It was a really tough decision to make, one that we thought two years ago would have been easier than it really was.

This was on top of her eyesight fading as well as her hearing is going as well. So she would often bark at us and get scared as people would move around the house or come near her. Not that we will ever know how much pain she was in but we could tell she was not enjoying life as she knew it anymore.\n\nWe believe our decision was right as we saw her health declining we didn't want her to suffer from day to day. Also, selfishly we didn't want her last days to be ones where we would be angry that she was throwing up all over and barking at us constantly.\n\nAs with our first dog, we wanted to be with her until the end and in our minds, that was again non-negotiable. We ended up using the same place that comes out to your house and performs the procedure with you being able to be right next to them.\n<h4>Final Day</h4>\nWe all tried to spend as much time with PJ as we could on the final day. I took her for a walk in the morning which I normally never do. Since it was a Sunday, we didn’t have as many commitments during the afternoon, so we were able to spend more time with her but since the weather was cold out we were unable to just be outside most of the day. However, while grocery shopping in the morning, my youngest and I decided to pick up some Frosty Paws <i>(Dog Ice Cream if you don’t know)</i> as well as a stuffed toy to let her play within the afternoon. When we got home and my daughter gave her the stuffed toy and PJ just sniffed it right away but it didn't really phase her too much. So I walked over to the toy, picked it up and gave it a squeeze, to which the toy made a squeaking sound and then I tossed it. Instantly, PJ seemed young again as she attacked the toy. She instantly grabbed hold of it and started shaking it violently and tossing it around and then jumping on it again. You see for some reason PJ has always had this thing about stuffed animals with squeakers in it. She is so persistent about disabling the squeaker that she will shred the toy and remove all stuffing just to find the squeaker and destroy it. Once she accomplishes this, she will not really play with the toy again. We had fun watching her play with the new toy and eventually moved on to the Frosty Paws that she really enjoys. After that, it was getting late in the afternoon and I figured since I couldn’t take an evening walk with her that now was probably the best time. It felt so strange walking down the same path we had so many times over the last year and a half, knowing it would be the last time. It is not that I will never walk on that path as it leads to a Lending Library by our house, but I knew I would be walking with more purpose other times as I wouldn’t have a dog to take on this walk after today.\n\nFinally around 5:20 we got the knock on the door and we knew that our time was finally up. It was a little harder this time as we knew what was going to happen and who knows PJ probably knew as well. I am glad that we could be with her the entire time as I still think it would be just as hard dropping her off someplace and then turning around and walking the other way.\n\nPJ, you truly were an amazing dog and I will miss you dearly.

It was in my early time using Twitter and started following people and companies in the Twin Cities. One day I finally realized that a couple guys and a company I was following, kept talking about this event as the weather was getting colder. As it turns out the company was SportsNgin (now called <a href=\"https://SportsEngine.com\">SportsEngine</a>), who was the major sponsor of the event and the guys who kept talking about it worked there and as luck would have it we're the co-founders of the company (Justin and Carson). I decided to do some reading about the event and found out it was a big deal and that it was happening in January. To top it off, they were looking for volunteers and I figured what better way to spend a day off work than being outside.\n\n<i>So you decided to take a day off work and volunteer to stand on the ice for 8 hours in what could be really cold January weather?</i>\n\nFair question, this probably piqued my interest more as I had just acquired the used materials for a <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2014/11/12/the-season-is.html/\">backyard rink</a> and was in the process of getting it ready for the cold. So as I was hearing about and seeing all of these pictures online of skating in the middle of a lake on an actual pond, I now wanted to see this event in person and watch some games.\n\n<em>Quick side story, I grew up in Iowa and have never played hockey in my life or really ice-skated in any prolonged amount of time. I used to rollerblade and play roller hockey in the street but nothing on the ice.</em>\n\n<h4>Side benefits of volunteering</h4>\nFor what started out to be a random event that I volunteered at, actually ended up being a place I meet a lot of interesting people. Some of these people were ones that I had interacted with on social media before and now that we were meeting face to face it was like we knew each other already. Also, the tournament brings in a bunch of people from all around the state of Minnesota, across the US, and even a couple countries, so it was always fun chatting with people to figure out where they came from and their background stories of playing hockey. That is one of the side benefits of volunteering in an area outside of your “normal” zone, you get to meet people you probably wouldn't have in your life. Every year since then I have enjoyed volunteering at the USPHC like the first. I continue to meet amazing people as well as keep in touch with some from previous years. Also, I get to spend a morning being outside on a big sheet of ice enjoying what nature has to offer (warm or cold). Through the years lots of efficiencies have been made in the Tournament operations as they have really upped their game, but at the core, it has stayed true to its roots of just getting people to play hockey outside as intended.\n\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/f57849a3c5.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\" />  \n\n<h4>Next year...</h4>\nWhen you start to think about it 5 years is a long time to do anything in my opinion. Even though I couldn't help out this year, I hope to make it to Nakomis and watch a couple of games. It really is an exciting event to watch in person and I haven't experienced anything quite like it.\n\nIf you have made it this far and want to see what it looks like check out the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL6zifIbpfnZph47xgohFWQ\">US Pond Hockey Championships YouTube channel</a> as they have some amazing videos from 2016 and 2017.

In my opinion, the value or what sets this book apart is that he does a good job breaking his thoughts down into bits that can be easily tackled.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5><i><b>My Running Story...</b></i></h5>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Let's be honest if I said we should run a 5k next month, and you haven't run for over a year, your head might spin. At the time it would seem like such a hurdle to climb and you might not even know where to start because you're too focused on the end result and not what could you do <strong>TODAY!</strong> Or as it is described in the book the Minimal Viable Action.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Minimally Viable Action—the smallest, most immediate step you can take that is doing what you want to do.</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For my example, I was that person, and a couple of years ago I decided to just go out and <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/02/09/back-to-running.html\">run</a> (in the dead of winter at that) with my non-GPS watch, my old pair of running shoes, and whatever other cold-weather workout clothes (or layers) I could find. I told myself I would run two blocks but after being out there I made it much further and then the next time I made it farther until having to walk. Each time I made it longer and sometimes faster until eventually it was just a habit and I was feeling healthier and had a good routine. When the month was up I realized I had already run a 5k and running another one wasn't going to be an issue.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><i><b>Some final thoughts…</b></i></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Reading a book like this helps give you motivation and encouragement as you reflect on yourself.

				"content_text": "<p>In our journey of living a more intentional life by decluttering our belongings and owning less. We have recently found out that house projects have helped us make larger strides in this overall journey.</p>\n\n<p>Owning an older house provides you with lots of fun opportunities to work on <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2012/03/15/master-bathroom-remodel.html\">projects</a> that might include: updating rooms by painting or carpeting; discovering issues or fixing leaks that need a professional or home handyman; or even just finding a room that needs a full remodel like an outdated kitchen.</p>\n\n<p>My wife and I have done all of the above over the last 9 years we have lived in our house. The worst part of any housing project is that you have to move all of your belongings from the area the project is taking place to another area. For most of our house projects up till a couple years ago, we would move everything from one place to another and then move it ALL back once we were done.</p>\n\n<p>However, in the past couple of years, my wife and I have realized that we need to use those disruptions in our normal space and be very mindful of what we put back once it is all done. In looking back, we have probably moved every piece of furniture, toys, books, boxes, pictures, or other items from one room to another as kids changed rooms and home projects happened. It would have made too much sense during those moves to time to take the extra couple of minutes to set things aside and only slowly add back what is truly needed.</p>\n\n<p>It probably wasn't until this latest project of our Kitchen remodel that we really took hold of this idea. We moved everything out of our Kitchen, Dining Room, and Living room as we had the wall separating all of those removed. It was a messy process that allows our family of 5 to get really cozy in the basement that only has 2 bedrooms.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the process by which we packed everything away but the couple single sets of kitchen stuff we needed follows that of what Ryan from <a href=\"https://www.theminimalists.com/packing/\">The Minimalists</a> described as a <b>packing party</b>. However, I am always under the mindset that you don’t really need a term or reason, you just need to figure out what works well for you. We are still on this long journey of slowly decluttering room by room and figuring out what makes sense for our family of 5 as we cannot take on too much at once or it would be utter chaos in our life.</p>\n\n<p>Once our kitchen was finished and it was time to move everything back in we only moved in things we needed and made sure it had a purpose. For the kitchen, this was really easy as everything was in boxes we only brought stuff out that we used for cooking on a daily or weekly basis. A couple things we noticed during this process were:</p>\n\n<ul><li><b>Coffee Cups (or drinkware)</b> - I love coffee but really who needs to have around 30 coffee cups. I am not sure who we were planning on inviting over for coffee or hot chocolate but we realized that was way too many.</li><li><b>Tupperware</b> - How can we have so much of this and nothing matches. Where did all the lids to the small-sized containers go and why am I stuck with so many large lids with no containers. Let's just say we didn’t keep a lot and have paired this down so we can always find a lid and dish.</li><li><b>Cooking Utensils </b>- Don’t get me wrong it is always great to have a spare but I am not sure we needed 10 spatulas. It was more than likely we only needed 2-3 as we used the same one most of the time.</li><li><b>Mismatched stuff </b>- During our cleaning out we found lots of plates, cups, and other items that were not a full set even though we had one full nice set already. These were perfect candidates to not work back into the cycle as one cup isn’t as good as a nice set of 12.</li></ul>\n\n<p>There were lots of other examples of that were we just had lots or multiples of items that we didn’t need to continue to keep around cluttering up shelves or drawers.</p>\n\n<p>In the living and dining rooms, our goal was to remove excess furniture and things on the wall to get a more minimalistic look. By removing excess furniture and having floor space, it allows us to now clean up more quickly. Not only is it a new space, where I enjoy the open floor plan, but I really enjoy having less stuff in the room. I feel like a burden has been lifted off us and it seems much more peaceful to enjoy. As I look around there is less to clean around and more space to just have fun with the kids and not have it feel so cramped because of the stuff we owned. One of the bigger changes we made during this time was to not keep any toys in the upstairs living room. That doesn’t mean the kids don’t bring their toys there to play or use the dining room table to draw, color, or play with play-doh on. It really just meant that we didn’t want that stuff to be stored in the living room as we found before that led to creating more mess. To accomplish this, we made sure those items previously stored in the living room that the kids wanted to keep had a place in their bedrooms or the toy room downstairs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Before:</strong></p>\n\n<!-- wp:gallery {\"ids\":[51122131,51122130,51122129],\"columns\":3,\"linkTo\":\"attachment\"} -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-3 is-cropped\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/00d146544a.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"51122131\" class=\"wp-image-51122131\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/fd10a654e9.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"51122130\" class=\"wp-image-51122130\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/69370fd6e8.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"51122129\" class=\"wp-image-51122129\"/></figure></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:gallery -->\n\n<p><strong>After:</strong></p>\n\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/68d5d1d465.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"188\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>As you can tell we couldn’t be happier with the space and are looking forward to enjoying it for years to come. Even though the remodel was a big project in itself, I feel a great side effect of it was that we were able to pack everything away and then Intentionally choose what to bring back into our living space.</p>\n\n<p>Once we had our living space set up as we liked it and brought back the items we felt were a good fit in our life, we donated the rest. This is another crucial step as you don’t want to be hanging on to boxes or stuff in another place of the house. I understand that you might not want to get rid of those items right away and if that is you, I would suggest you set a calendar reminder to find that box(es) buried in the garage that you need to donate at a specific date in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Have you had a housing remodel or project in the past and found it a good time to declutter items? If so I would love to hear how it went for you and if you think it was successful. If not and you have a project on the horizon let me know about it and share your success after it is all done.</p>\n",

However, I am glad I read this one as it was the perfect size for me to digest in my normally busy week.  Not to mention I am a fan of  Eliot's work and this is another one that doesn't disappoint and couldn't put it down. Let's just say it was good for me that it was a short story. The main topic of the book is around discrimination but is set in a more future state. Even though this book is a short story Elliot masterfully writes it in great detail with various twists you might not see coming.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":51121729,\"align\":\"center\",\"linkDestination\":\"custom\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/True-Short-Story-Eliot-Peper-ebook/dp/B072WZSWMZ/?tag=stthink-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/ffe3fd4fac.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-51121729\"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> I really can't say enough about <g class=\"gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del\" id=\"4\" data-gr-id=\"4\">the</g> book and don't want to give too much of it away so go grab a copy as you can't beat the price as it only 2.99 (or free if you have Kindle Unlimited).  So go grab a copy today and start your weekend off right. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

This past year the continued theme for me was to lead a healthier life, which mostly involved me spending more time outside running, biking with the kids, and ultimately trying to stay more active on a week-to-week basis.</p>\n<p>This past year my wife and I also made a big decision that she was going to take a year off from Teaching in a way to slow down our crazy hustle and bustle life. With three kids there is never really a slow moment but we thought this would help us not rush the kids out the door by 7 am with us yelling at them because they were moving slowly and tired. I will say it has been a great change for the family she has been home to get our oldest on and off the bus each day, taking our middle child to Pre-School and the being able to spend time with the youngest while the older ones are off to school. I am sure some of it depends on the day but overall she has been enjoying this change and it has allowed our family to not feel so rushed.</p>\n<p>For me specifically in trying to slow down or reprioritize my efforts I have started to really evaluate where I spend my time outside of work and realized I need to start saying “NO” to certain projects/volunteering activities. While I can’t say I have really severed ties with anything yet it has been on my mind as 2017 started and I have put a plan in place to evaluate those various activities as I want to make sure I am getting the most out of my days and making sure I am spending it where I want to spend it (more on this in a future post). Also, I realized it is very important for me to reevaluate things like that as work has become more time-consuming and I still want to put my best effort forward and still find time for the other things but knowing it can’t be everything.</p>\n<p>Finally, this past year was a great milestone as my wife and I celebrated our <!-- raw HTML omitted -->10th Wedding Anniversary<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. However, on a sad note last year we had to say goodbye to our 13-year-old Yorkshire Terrier <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tucker<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and our youngest child says she misses him each day.</p>\n<p>Finally, as I look forward to what 36 will bring for me I am not entirely sure. One thing is for sure, though, I will continue to make tweaks to my routines, projects, and continue to work on cultivating/making time for the true friendships I have. One big thing that will happen in the upcoming year is that we are going to take a road trip from Minnesota to Maine in the late summer. It will be a two-week trip one on the road and one on the ocean. That trip could mark the beginning of yearly family road trips or the final one… time will tell :).</p>\n<p>I have learned so much in the last year and I hope to continue that going forward.</p>\n<p>Previously: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->35<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",

With three kids there is never really a slow moment but we thought this would help us not rush the kids out the door by 7 am with us yelling at them because they were moving slowly and tired. I will say it has been a great change for the family she has been home to get our oldest on and off the bus each day, taking our middle child to Pre-School and the being able to spend time with the youngest while the older ones are off to school. I am sure some of it depends on the day but overall she has been enjoying this change and it has allowed our family to not feel so rushed.\n\nFor me specifically in trying to slow down or reprioritize my efforts I have started to really evaluate where I spend my time outside of work and realized I need to start saying “NO” to certain projects/volunteering activities. While I can’t say I have really severed ties with anything yet it has been on my mind as 2017 started and I have put a plan in place to evaluate those various activities as I want to make sure I am getting the most out of my days and making sure I am spending it where I want to spend it (more on this in a future post). Also, I realized it is very important for me to reevaluate things like that as work has become more time-consuming and I still want to put my best effort forward and still find time for the other things but knowing it can’t be everything.\n\nFinally, this past year was a great milestone as my wife and I celebrated our <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/10/14/years.html\">10th Wedding Anniversary</a>. However, on a sad note last year we had to say goodbye to our 13-year-old Yorkshire Terrier <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/10/07/tucker-buddy.html\">Tucker</a> and our youngest child says she misses him each day.\n\nFinally, as I look forward to what 36 will bring for me I am not entirely sure. One thing is for sure, though, I will continue to make tweaks to my routines, projects, and continue to work on cultivating/making time for the true friendships I have. One big thing that will happen in the upcoming year is that we are going to take a road trip from Minnesota to Maine in the late summer. It will be a two-week trip one on the road and one on the ocean. That trip could mark the beginning of yearly family road trips or the final one… time will tell :).\n\nI have learned so much in the last year and I hope to continue that going forward.\n\nPreviously: <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/03/24/thirtyfive.html\">35</a>\n",

What I really want is this to be a community-driven site by the members.”</blockquote>\nThat statement is still as true to me today as it was a year ago when I wrote it and for good reason. I knew that for some of us “life” just gets in the way and I am one of those people. I was super active in this community early on and for a good chunk of time until about December 2016 when “<em><strong>life</strong></em>” got busy. I could tell you lots of reasons why I thought that happened but heck, it happens to all of us right?  That is why I believed the only way this site would survive is if we have a community feel and that community could be active on its own. Even though I have not been as actively posting or prompting in the past couple of months I still browse the comments and click to read new posts from people I am not actively following.\n\nWell, enough about me and back to the community!

 Wouldn't you think the IRS would have a messaging service or voice mail or something?</em>\n\nI decided to call back from my original number and someone answered who knew me from the first time or at least my name must have come up.  I asked some questions like I didn't know what they were talking about from the first time but only because I wanted to hang up on them.  Then about 30 seconds later, I got the masked call again from my local Police department, no greeting or anything but saying they have been trying to get a hold of me for a half hour since a fax came over.  They wanted to know my address so they could send an officer to pick me up right away.  I asked for the person name and he said his name was Mary Ellis.  If you picked up on the fact I was addressing Mary as a he, it was because the person on the phone was trying to sound like a girl but was more than likely the exact same person I was just talking to.  In fact, I could hear the same background noise of people talking about Taxes where I am guessing \"Zach's\" friends were trying to scam someone else.  I told him, who was acting as the local authorities, it was interesting that they had been trying to get a hold of me for the past 30 min as I had just talked to my local authorities who knew nothing about needing me.  At that point, the person hung up, scam over.\n\nDuring and after everything was done I obviously reported the number and any important information to the <a href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/tigta/\">Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration</a> (TIGTA).  It sounds like these scams are increasing as of lately for an unknown reason but remember most of the \"scam\" points I was noting above are noted on the <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/uac/newsroom/scam-phone-calls-continue-irs-identifies-five-easy-ways-to-spot-suspicious-calls\">IRS websites</a> of things to look out for.  Here is another government site with a nice Infographic on <a href=\"https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0519-irs-imposter-scams-infographic\">IRS Imposter Scams</a>. Finally, I have included a good video below talking about IRS Imposter Scams.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i4nCy6Xs6R8\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nJust be careful out there as the people on the other line try to make it sound legit.  I hope it doesn't and hasn't happened to any of you.  However, if it has leave a comment below as I would enjoy hearing how it went for you and if your experience was similar to my story.\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I stumbled upon this older TED talk (was recorded back in 2010) and felt it worth sharing. I think it is a topic is still very relevant today as most employers always talk about how they are giving employees great work-life balance. However, one point that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nigel Marsh<!-- raw HTML omitted --> points out is the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Certain job, and career choices are fundamentally incompatible with being meaningful engaged on a daily basis with a young family. - Nigel Marsh</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Seeing how I have a young family at home I can relate how each employees definition of what Work-Life balance should be and should look like can differ drastically. As I have only worked at a couple companies through out my career, I know each has had their own version of work-life balance and I would say each had good and bad parts to it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t design your life someone else WILL design it for you and you may not like their idea of balance. - Nigel Marsh</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For me, I work for a company that is fairly flexible in my opinion.

I think it is a topic is still very relevant today as most employers always talk about how they are giving employees great work-life balance. However, one point that <a href=\"https://nigelmarsh.com/\">Nigel Marsh</a> points out is the following: \n\n>Certain job, and career choices are fundamentally incompatible with being meaningful engaged on a daily basis with a young family. - Nigel Marsh\n\nSeeing how I have a young family at home I can relate how each employees definition of what Work-Life balance should be and should look like can differ drastically. As I have only worked at a couple companies through out my career, I know each has had their own version of work-life balance and I would say each had good and bad parts to it.\n\n>If you don't design your life someone else WILL design it for you and you may not like their idea of balance. - Nigel Marsh  \n\nFor me, I work for a company that is fairly flexible in my opinion. I won't say everything is exactly how I would imagine my perfect day but they value family and that helps for where I am at in my life. I think for my personal situation it is trying to balance my own definition of how I want work/life to balance out on a daily, weekly, monthly basis given my situation, job, priorities. It is a constant balancing act between all of those points which is why there isn't a one size fits all solution and you just need to make the most of it.\n\n***What is your definition of work-life balance?***\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Not to mention Mattermark the company is doing some pretty cool things on top of this daily newsletter.</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://contest.inside.com/giveaways/amazon-echo-giveaway/?lucky=152\">Inside Daily Brief</a> (side note you can win an Amazon Echo if you sign) - Now this one is super new for me but I have been subscribed since they started.  I will say it has been changing a lot since it started as it is trying to get formatting, content type, and other things ironed out.  However, one thing is for sure they have some great summaries of top news stories of the day.  Not sure if the trend will continue but earlier on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jason\">Jason Calacanis</a> was sending out a shared Google Doc to twitter for everyone to come help make suggestions before the next Daily Brief was published.  I can't wait to see how this one continues to evolve and wish the team the best.</li>\n</ul>\nEach of them provides something different which is why for me I can see them lasting in my routine for a while.\n\nFinal side note on News apps, I installed NextDraft app on my phone but never really use it because the email is so perfect for my routine as it is in a place I already look and can access it anywhere.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on News Apps and do you think one will really stick around?  If you are a frequent user of one let me know what your favorite one is as I am always game to try new apps.\n",

				"title": "\"Uncommon Stock: Exit Strategy\" by Eliot Peper",
				"content_html": "<p>The final book in the Uncommon Stock series hit the shelves on July 29, 2015 and if you were like me you had already pre-ordered it so it would be instantly sent to your Kindle.   </p>\n<p>If you missed the launch of the Part III, don&rsquo;t worry you can pick it up from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Amazon for only $4.99<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (it is a steal).   </p>\n<p>Trust me you will not be disappointed with Part III, just as the first two books were well worth it.  Now if you haven&rsquo;t read them yet I would suggest you read all three in order (here is my take on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Part II, Uncommon Stock: Power Play<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>\n<p>I was really excited to see how the whole journey of Mara and James unfolded in this book and it was too perfect that it hit the shelves right before I had a long trip to China.  I started reading it on my long flights and wished I wouldn&rsquo;t have had other things that kept distracting me along the way.</p>\n<p>However, since the team I was with never went into work until 8am I had plenty of time after waking up at 4am, as I wasn&rsquo;t able to sleep any longer, to continue reading.  The only bad part about that was I didn&rsquo;t want to put it down when I knew it was time to catch the cab.  Also, it helped that domestic flights in China seem to be delayed often which allowed me to finish the book and write this posting.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>Now onto Exit Strategy, the story puts you right back into the fast-paced life of the Mozaik startup roller coaster.  </p>\n<p>Eliot does a great job keeping your thoughts focused on wondering what Mara is going to do next and how are they ever going to take down Maelstrom.  Not to mention you are captivated by the underlying story about Mozaik, the company you have been rooting for since Part 1.  He does a great job walking you through some of the real-life examples of the pains that Startups go through from the beginning all the way through IPOs.  Honestly, this is one of those books that touches on so many topics that it probably appeals to people that like all kinds of books from mystery, suspense and action.

				"content_text": "The final book in the Uncommon Stock series hit the shelves on July 29, 2015 and if you were like me you had already pre-ordered it so it would be instantly sent to your Kindle.   \n\nIf you missed the launch of the Part III, don't worry you can pick it up from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Uncommon-Stock-Exit-Strategy-Book-ebook/dp/B0116B9ILS/?tag=stthink-20\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon for only $4.99</a> (it is a steal).   \n\nTrust me you will not be disappointed with Part III, just as the first two books were well worth it.  Now if you haven't read them yet I would suggest you read all three in order (here is my take on <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2015/03/18/uncommon-stock-power.html\">Part II, Uncommon Stock: Power Play</a>).  \n\nI was really excited to see how the whole journey of Mara and James unfolded in this book and it was too perfect that it hit the shelves right before I had a long trip to China.  I started reading it on my long flights and wished I wouldn't have had other things that kept distracting me along the way.  \n\nHowever, since the team I was with never went into work until 8am I had plenty of time after waking up at 4am, as I wasn't able to sleep any longer, to continue reading.  The only bad part about that was I didn't want to put it down when I knew it was time to catch the cab.  Also, it helped that domestic flights in China seem to be delayed often which allowed me to finish the book and write this posting.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Uncommon-Stock-Exit-Strategy-Book-ebook/dp/B0116B9ILS/?tag=stthink-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-51118258\" src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/f0989fe441.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"480\"  alt=\"\"/></a>\n\nNow onto Exit Strategy, the story puts you right back into the fast-paced life of the Mozaik startup roller coaster.   \n\nEliot does a great job keeping your thoughts focused on wondering what Mara is going to do next and how are they ever going to take down Maelstrom.  Not to mention you are captivated by the underlying story about Mozaik, the company you have been rooting for since Part 1.  He does a great job walking you through some of the real-life examples of the pains that Startups go through from the beginning all the way through IPOs.  Honestly, this is one of those books that touches on so many topics that it probably appeals to people that like all kinds of books from mystery, suspense and action. Then to top that off it is about this Startup company trying to catch people involved in financial fraud, murder, and deception.  \n\nNow I could probably write on and on about what happened but that would just ruin the fun of reading it.  So I will at least give you a couple of my favorite quotes/sayings from the book that stuck out to me.  I think each of these just go to show the amount of information beyond being a good story is packed into this book and more specifically this series.\n\n>The short version is that when you lay good code on top of bad code, the result is still bad code.\n\n>You can't wait until you had enough time for exercise.

				"content_html": "<p>This is a very long overdue post about a book I read titled “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sleep your way to the Top (and other myths about business success)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->” by Jane Miller.  I was actually lucky enough to get a copy from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FG Press<!-- raw HTML omitted --> not long after I had <!-- raw HTML omitted -->written<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about the number of books I had been listening to so far in 2014.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Honestly, when I got the email with instructions on where to get the book I had no idea what the book was about.  Since I was lucky enough to get a copy of the book, I decided to take the challenge of reading it. It was defiantly worth my time and I would encourage anyone and everyone to read this book.  It is packed with great life lessons/thoughts based on the situations, successes, and mistakes that Jane made.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;No decision is a bad decision&hellip; if you learn from it.&rdquo; - Jane Miller</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It touches on various topics like resume writing, interviewing, being a team player, and when is the right time to leave a company.  At the end of each chapter, there are questions to ask yourself, that I believe are designed to make you more aware of your strengths and weaknesses.  Also, depending on where you are in your career you can use some of the questions/situations she poses to help you try to figure out what your dream job is and how that may or may not relate to your current job/role.</p>\n<p>I wish I could have read this book when I was in college getting ready to graduate as there are some really good life lessons that everyone goes through in the world of business.  The best part is that all of those tips and lessons are embedded in a funny and captivating story.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Let me tell you something.

				"content_text": "This is a very long overdue post about a book I read titled “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Your-Way-Top-business-ebook/dp/B01JPOHNJC/?tag=stthink-20\">Sleep your way to the Top (and other myths about business success)</a>” by Jane Miller.  I was actually lucky enough to get a copy from <a href=\"http://fgpress.com/\">FG Press</a> not long after I had <a title=\"Books, Books, and more Books\" href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2014/06/13/books-books-and.html\">written</a> about the number of books I had been listening to so far in 2014.\n\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/90a39628fe.jpg\" alt=\"Sleep Your Way to the Top by Jane Miller\" class=\"wp-image-51117494\" width=\"600\" alt=\"\" />  \n\nHonestly, when I got the email with instructions on where to get the book I had no idea what the book was about.  Since I was lucky enough to get a copy of the book, I decided to take the challenge of reading it. It was defiantly worth my time and I would encourage anyone and everyone to read this book.  It is packed with great life lessons/thoughts based on the situations, successes, and mistakes that Jane made.\n\n>\"No decision is a bad decision... if you learn from it.\" - Jane Miller  \n\nIt touches on various topics like resume writing, interviewing, being a team player, and when is the right time to leave a company.  At the end of each chapter, there are questions to ask yourself, that I believe are designed to make you more aware of your strengths and weaknesses.  Also, depending on where you are in your career you can use some of the questions/situations she poses to help you try to figure out what your dream job is and how that may or may not relate to your current job/role.  \n\nI wish I could have read this book when I was in college getting ready to graduate as there are some really good life lessons that everyone goes through in the world of business.  The best part is that all of those tips and lessons are embedded in a funny and captivating story.  \n\n>\"Let me tell you something. You stupid little runt.  I own you. You're my bitch.  So don't walk around here thinking you have free will, because you don't.  I could crush you anytime I want.  So settle in, 'cause you are here for the long haul.\" - Dave Harkien, Horrible Bosses (film)  \n\nFinishing this book was really easy, the only painful part was my lack of sleep since I couldn't put the book down as I always wanted to finish another chapter before shutting my eyes.  \n\nSo if you are looking for a good book to read I would definitely encourage you to find this book and while you are at it check out Jane Miller's website to read other things she has written <a href=\"http://janeknows.com/\">http://janeknows.com/</a>.\n",

Otherwise, you will end up installing one that wasn't the same color (Yes this happened to me see below).</li>\n\t<li>Buy the right trowel for the size of tile you are using and then make sure you don't use too much mortar.  Especially, be careful on the small tiles as I spent a lot of time in the back end trying to scrape it out of the joints so my grout would fill it later.</li>\n\t<li>You will run into more problems than you anticipated and are going to start replacing a lot more things (e.g., Pipes, Sub-floor, Walls).</li>\n\t<li>Did I mention that you should overbuy things at your Home Improvement Store</li>\n\t<li>Realize that as you are going to get sidetracked by your significant other to complete \"Fluff\" projects some of which are unrelated to the task at hand.</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/8fcb1f033a.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" alt=\"\" />\n\n \n",

				"content_text": "If it's a deadline, email, phone call, blogging, or working out everyone has something they procrastinate about and always say, \"I wish I could do better.\" &nbsp;So,&nbsp;what is the \"Seinfeld Strategy\" and how does it work you are probably wondering. &nbsp;The advice that Jerry Seinfeld gave to Brad Issac (<a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret\"><em>LifeHacker</em></a>), who wanted to be a better comic, was simple, \"Write everyday and don't break the chain.\"\n\nMore specifically this is what Seinfeld told him to do:\n\n\n<img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/aedd445e78.jpg\" alt=\"6060403011 83eabcda95 o\" title=\"6060403011_83eabcda95_o.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"600\" />  \n*Image Credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomashawk/\">Thomas Hawk</a>*  \n\n\"Get a big wall calendar that has a whole year on one page and hang it on a prominent wall. Then get a big red magic marker. For each day that you complete your task of writing, put a big red X over that day.  \n\nThen after a few days you'll have a chain. Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day. &nbsp;You'll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job next is to not break the chain.\"\n\nI actually read an article published by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/james_clear\">James Clear</a><span style=\"line-height:1.5;\"> from <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-clear/success-and-motivation_b_3624606.html\"> The <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-clear/success-and-motivation_b_3624606.html\"> Huffington Post</a></em> six months ago which referenced the same story and had his own take on the matter.

Then see how people react in comments, on Twitter etc. I guess some bloggers don’t like comments but for me they are the crucial so that I can get feedback on new hypotheses. Blogging new hypotheses also means a decent portion of your blog posts need to be ignored or ridiculed. Otherwise you are playing it too safe.</em></p>\n<em></em>The one sentence that really stuck out for me was the first.  So instead of making excuses that I don't have anything to write about or that I don't have time to write, I should find one interesting thing ever week to write about.  I am guessing some weeks it will be more interesting than others but if anything that will help get the habit formed.  Just as if you were going to run a marathon, it all starts with the consistency of running before you can really start building up the miles.\n",
