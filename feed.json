Especially when the Grandkids are around.\n\n![](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/341da575a5.jpg)\n\n![](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/c5b7a7a596.jpg)\n\n*Doodle checking out the fish*\n\n**Fishing**\n\nI feel like everyone caught a lot of fish. Unfortunately only one person got the luck job of taking the fish off and putting a new worm back on 🙄.\n\n![](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/b8a156ee9a.jpg)\n\n![](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/6dbf26279d.jpg)\n\n![](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/6f369bfc63.jpg)\n\n![](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/16859ced53.jpg)\n\n![](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/d1382007b2.jpg)\n\n![](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/53dfd79278.jpg)\n\n![](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/ed5dfda2f2.jpg)\n\n![](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/dcff0637ef.jpg)\n\n![](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/8024671483.jpg)\n\n**Riding around the Farm**\n\n![](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/52d30e2535.jpg)\n\n*April, Doodle and I*\n\n![](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/760770bdb3.jpg)\n\n*Brother and Sister*\n\n![](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/524a9ad411.jpg)\n\n*Sisters*\n\n![](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/25c3f4754a.jpg)\n\n*Even the Doodle got to ride along*\n\n![](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/859e0f267b.jpg)\n\n*Drawing on the dock*\n\nAlso, was great just hanging out with family.\n\n![](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/ee18301ed7.jpg)\n\n![](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2022/b57aedae2f.jpg)\n\n*I still can’t believe how tall my son is.

This year I am still going to focus on other aspects of <strong>“Embracing”</strong> which has been kind of an ongoing one but more around Embracing moments. I think being kind of locked up for the last two years (which it was good to be safe) has led me to not be as outgoing as I was and I know that needs to change slightly. I think there should be some easy wins here but just need to make the <em>time</em> and <strong>commitment</strong> to do it.

We have a couple trips in the works for the summer that should be really fun. One with the RV and the other just flying somewhere. As a family we haven’t flew anywhere for such a long time. Additionally, I need to work some more on my “Project Shed” to get it in a better place to work before summer when the kids are at home every day.\n\nI don’t think I did much around “Learning” this past year and for the life of me I am not sure what I was going to do. I guess silly as it is I learned (re-learned) how to be a longer distance runner but I don’t think that is what I was thinking. This year I am still going to focus on other aspects of **“Embracing”** which has been kind of an ongoing one but more around Embracing moments. I think being kind of locked up for the last two years (which it was good to be safe) has led me to not be as outgoing as I was and I know that needs to change slightly. I think there should be some easy wins here but just need to make the *time* and **commitment** to do it. Probably part putting myself out there again after all this time at home 😁.\n\nPreviously: [35](https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/03/24/thirtyfive.html), [36](https://ericmwalk.blog/2017/03/24/thirtysix.html), [37](https://ericmwalk.blog/2018/03/24/thirtyseven.html), [38](https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/03/24/thirtyeight.html), [39](https://ericmwalk.blog/2020/03/24/thirtynine.html), [40](https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/03/24/forty.html) ..\n\n",

With the new computer, the nice advantage is I have been able to remotely log into it and it is fast enough that I could look through old stuff and organize other things to fit with the process we use now.

This involved rolling up my old Website and then importing my Instagram photos. Both of the projects are “Done” in theory. However, there is a lot more clean-up than I anticipated so this will be an ongoing project for a while. I thought I had the website import done and cleaned up but now that I am still working on the Instagram stuff I am finding more that did not come through due to the issues I outlined in that <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2022/01/05/all-in-on.html\">post</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Plex.tv</strong> - I got this installed on an old Mac I have stashed away in the basement after hearing it come up from time to time in conversations from others. My first thought was to use it as an easier way to access Pictures and Videos I had stored on a central storage device in my house. We store all of our pictures and videos there (which is then backed up to Backblaze) but sometimes getting them back or finding them again is not as easy as it should be. File sharing is slow to display previews and standing in the laundry room to use the computer isn’t ideal either. So I have only added at this point the 2021 photo library we have as the scan on this old thing takes a while and I also need this computer to do other work <em>(see below)</em></li>\n<li><strong>DVDs</strong> (Part 1) - I got this crazy idea to clean out this DVD shelf that has too many DVDs of which never get used but you can see it in the background of all my WebEx calls. I realized that I could just box them up and put them away but some of them I realized I don’t have digitally and now that my kids are getting older I might want to watch with them. Unfortunately, before I started to box any of these up my wife reminded me that we do use the DVDs sometimes when we go Camping since streaming is not an option. Sometimes it is nice to have some on hand as a backup when it rains. Hoping there was a way to figure this all out I was reminded of an article from fellow Micro.blog friend Jason Burk describing how he created the <a href=\"https://burk.io/2021/creating-the-golden-set\">Golden Set</a> by converting his DVDs to MP4s. <strong>BINGO</strong> now I had a project. *Current status is after a couple trial and errors, I have done about 150 of our DVDs and I feel like I have a long way to go.</li>\n<li><strong>DVDs</strong> (Part 2) - Due to some of the trial and errors of the first project I dug out an old computer I had gotten long ago. Come to find out it would be the perfect DVD machine but I realized that it did not have windows on it and that sent me down a path of digging through old CDs to find some sort of Windows CDs from past systems. I did find an old copy of Windows 8 which was working fine until I couldn’t seem to get any updates to fix the mouse drivers and whatnot. The solution was going to be to buy Windows 10 (which I wasn’t excited about) but I found out I was eligible for a free Windows 10 upgrade. That all worked well but it took some time to get to that point.</li>\n<li><strong>Storage</strong> 🤦‍♂️&hellip; As you work through the above projects you can only guess this leads to the question of do you have enough storage for all of these DVDs that you are going to now make digital? The answer is NO.. No, I do not. However, this was going to be an issue before this project took off as a couple of months ago I realized my 4TB HD was getting within 100GB of reaching the end of its life. To me, that is too close. <em>I need to still figure this out in the meantime I had a 2TB removable drive that I am currently putting all the movies on after I pull them off the DVDs.

				"content_html": "<p>Two weeks ago I decided to set off on completing a <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/01/xx-running-challenge.html\">4x4x40</a> as part of some crazy ideas for my 40th birthday year. However, after I reached the 40 miles I felt like I really needed to continue as I figured at that point I might never do this again and get so close to hitting the real number and completing a 4x4x48 (run 4 miles every 4 hours for 48 hours). Maybe it helped that I was a bit sleep deprived at the time and not thinking clearly as I figured what was two more 4 mile runs at that point.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/d0d7eda4b0.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Since I posted after each of my runs with a short photo, time, and thought I will not rehash all of them. I don’t want to make light of this challenge as I think it was hard but the miles themselves weren’t the worst for me. Some of that could have been that I didn’t really have a pace per mile in mind. I obviously wasn’t going to try to run the fastest 4 miles I could every time. However, in my mind, I wanted to keep all of my averages per run under 9 min/miles. The biggest struggle for me during this challenge was trying to fit it in during a normal working day. Due to the weather forecast and maybe my last-minute planning, as it was December, I did it during the middle of a workweek. So I scheduled it out earlier in the week and pretty much created an appointment for myself every 4 hrs. It worked great the first day but the second day some things came up at work so I had to shrink down one of my 3 hr blocks of <em>recovery</em> and extend other ones. I still was able to get the run in that 4 hr bock but I wasn’t as consistently on the hour as I was the first day of running. In a way, I am wondering if working both days helped me keep my focus away from running and how tired I might have been as I was doing things I needed to do during the day. Then in the evenings I still helped get the kids to activities and stuff.</p>\n<p>Now obviously the lack of sleep is one thing but the worst time of runs for me was the 5am runs that I did. I think it is because after the late-night 1am run it always took me longer than anticipated to fall asleep. You would have thought I would have been tired enough to just get into the house and fall asleep. I am guessing that the kick of adrenaline that was in my body messed with allowing my brain to shut down at that time. So for both days by the time I would will myself to sleep and it would work I think I only got 1 hr before I would have to wake up at 5am to run. After that run, I would just start my day and didn’t try to get any more rest as my youngest gets on the bus at 7am.</p>\n<p>In the end, I have never run so many miles in two days. It ended up being 48.9 miles due to one run when I put my trust in a running friend who lead me astray by an extra mile. Those two days were more mileage than I had completed any week during my marathon training this past year. It was an interesting challenge as it took careful planning as I still worked and helped with kid activities like a normal day. It was just I ran every 4 hrs 😁. The day after I was done I felt pretty wiped out from most likely lack of sleep and over-exercise. Fast forward two weeks later and I am back on track. Maybe I will do another one of these challenges someday but probably no time soon. At least for the rest of this year, it will be back to the normal scheduled running for me.<br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h4 id=\"full-data-of-runs---links-to-posts-and-strava\">Full Data of Runs - Links to Posts and Strava</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/01/running-log-xx.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 1/10 (1:01 am)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6328757476\">4.02 miles at 8:39/mi pace, 36°F 🌧</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/01/183000.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 2/10 (5:02 am)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6329422080\">4.02 miles at 8:55/mi pace, 37°F 🌘🌥</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/01/184500.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 3/10 (9:00 am)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6330251888\">4.01 miles at 8:51/mi pace, 36°F 🌥</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/01/191500.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 4/10 (1:01 pm)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6331221972\">4.02 miles at 8:33/mi pace, 45°F ☁️</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/01/193000.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 5/10 (4:41 pm)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6331966369\">4.02 miles at 8:59/mi pace, 50°F 🌥</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/01/214806.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 6/10 (7:57 pm)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6332480665\">4.01 miles at 8:31/mi pace, 48°F 🌥</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/02/running-log-xx.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 7/10 (1:02 am)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6332890004\">4.02 miles at 8:47/mi pace, 47°F ☁️</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/02/055602.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 8/10 (5:04 am)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6333540689\">4.02 miles at 8:59/mi pace, 40°F 🌌</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/02/113029.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 9/10 (9:52 am)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6334553267\"> 4.02 miles at 8:35/mi pace, 38°F ☀️</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/02/143306.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 10/10 (12:58 pm)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6335309327\">4.69 miles at 8:06/mi pace, 45°F ☁️</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/02/180000.html\">Running Log: 4x4x44 - 11/10 (4:46 pm)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6336063574\">4.03 miles at 8:27/mi pace, 41°F ☁️</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/02/220254.html\">Running Log: 4x4x48 - 12/10 (8:51 pm)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6336606100\">4.03 miles at 8:35/mi pace, 39°F 🌧</a></em></li>\n</ul>\n",

I am not really sure what I was thinking but I believe in a way it was because I had not keep up running much from my High School days and missed it. I also thought I would share in the punishment and poor college student me signed my brother up (who was working at the time) as well since he lived in Minneapolis. I figured what was he going to do if I signed him up for it, not show up?</p>\n<p>I jumped right into some training plan I am sure I found on the internet at the time and was following it religiously throughout that summer as I stayed up at school and all my friends went home. However, when the training plan started to tick up miles school was back in session and my training fell off the radar. I don’t even think I ran anything of value or consistency the month before the race. Talk about coming in cold. In fact, the longest I had run before that 2001 Marathon was 13 miles.</p>\n<p>Let’s just say the day turned out as you would have expected, the adrenaline and excitement pushed me though probably 17 miles worth. Then I gritted it out for another 3 that I can’t remember. The last 6.2 miles were torchure and I think most of it has escaped me. From what I remember it was a lot of walking for that last 6.2 miles and seems right as up to that point I was tracking time well and then it took me one and fifteen minutes to complete that last 6.2 miles. I remember finally realizing that I as only 1 mile from the finish and I think that is when I started to somewhat run again knowing the end was finally in sight. The best part of that race was that I crossed the finish line with my uncle and to this day we all still joke how I touched the finish line first.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/2a678fda02.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>However, in reality when I was dying on those last miles at some point he passed me up and I caught back up to him in the final stretch. Since that time but probably not right after I kept telling myself that if I was ever going to run another one and I did want to I wanted to make sure I trained for it much better than before. Don’t get me wrong it wasn’t that the time was overly horrible but I knew I could have done better so it was my goal.</p>\n",

However, when the training plan started to tick up miles school was back in session and my training fell off the radar. I don’t even think I ran anything of value or consistency the month before the race. Talk about coming in cold. In fact, the longest I had run before that 2001 Marathon was 13 miles. \n\nLet’s just say the day turned out as you would have expected, the adrenaline and excitement pushed me though probably 17 miles worth. Then I gritted it out for another 3 that I can’t remember. The last 6.2 miles were torchure and I think most of it has escaped me. From what I remember it was a lot of walking for that last 6.2 miles and seems right as up to that point I was tracking time well and then it took me one and fifteen minutes to complete that last 6.2 miles. I remember finally realizing that I as only 1 mile from the finish and I think that is when I started to somewhat run again knowing the end was finally in sight. The best part of that race was that I crossed the finish line with my uncle and to this day we all still joke how I touched the finish line first. \n\n![](https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/2a678fda02.jpg)\n\nHowever, in reality when I was dying on those last miles at some point he passed me up and I caught back up to him in the final stretch. Since that time but probably not right after I kept telling myself that if I was ever going to run another one and I did want to I wanted to make sure I trained for it much better than before. Don’t get me wrong it wasn’t that the time was overly horrible but I knew I could have done better so it was my goal.\n\n",

There are always obstacles in the way, better things to do, or thinking we are too busy to do something. As a &ldquo;runner&rdquo; myself, I can personally relate to the specific stories of running as no matter how much I love running, being outdoors, It is much better to have the run done and behind me as I too am someone that struggles most of the time to just get out the door.

The best thing is it is a smaller-sized book so you can carry it with you on all of your adventures (well maybe not while running) so you can refer to the helpful motivational kick in the butt that is needed from time to time while doing anything.

Then it would maybe be silly to share out small bite-sized shares like photos, random thoughts, or other articles you might find interesting. On the flip side, you could just include the interesting thoughts, photos, and articles throughout the week and share it out once.</p>\n<p>For now, I don't think this is something I would do but I do find it an interesting concept and would be very interested in knowing if anyone else has done this or thought about it too. </p>\n<p>My experience with just newsletters is that I have tried it a couple of times in the past but was never really sure what to put in a newsletter that I hadn't already shared via social media or posted on my blog. This is, even more, the case now that I have started to use Micro.blog more for a single spot of all information as you don't have to try to figure out where it was posted.</p>\n",

				"title": "Treadmill vs Exercise Bike",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I have always liked the idea of an exercise bike. In fact, last December when my wife was talking about buying one over a treadmill I told her to go for it. I assumed since I run so much outside in all kinds of weather why would I choose to run inside and not really moving? I mean, I like to explore the outdoors in all seasons. Snow, Ice, Ran, wicked winds all of those don't deter me if I am planning on running or want to run. Even in smog-filled cities or cities, I don't even know where I am going I prefer to run outside than on the treadmill. So easy enough a bike for indoors makes sense then... Or does it...</p>\n<p>Over the past year, I have used the exercise bike 4 times, yep only 4, and one of them was in the first couple of days trying it out and the most recent time was today 😁. Don't get me wrong it isn't like the bike is buried away somewhere in the house so it is out of sight out of mind. In fact quite the opposite, since I have been working from home since March, it is in the same room as me so I can't really say I forgot about it 😁.</p>\n<p>After some reflection and conversation with friends, I realized I would have been better off with a treadmill. It wouldn't have taken the place of my running, well maybe once or twice but ultimately I could have been walking on it while on phone calls or watching TV. The times when I can't leave the house for a run but could move at a moderate clip to get some exercise in.</p>\n<p>\n  Now you might be thinking you could do the same with an exercise bike Eric! And yes, that is true but the difference is the key...\n  <br />\n</p>\n<p>\n  <b><i>You have to keep moving or you will fall on the treadmill vs exercise bike you can slow to a stop and not give the same movement or output.</i></b>\n</p>\n<p>That right there is my answer. On a treadmill, you have to just let your subconscious take over to keep your legs moving at the pace you set. If not well it might not end well...</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/3cff2b39c7.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n<p>On the bike, however, I have to monitor the pace and use brainpower to have my legs move at the speed I want because the bike will not keep moving and pushing me forward. That right there gives me too much room to fail.</p>\n<p>It isn't that I am not determined in my workouts or exercise routines. It is just I am smart about it, I know my body and sometimes I need to trick it or force its hand. A couple of weeks back I was thinking I should run further but wasn't sure I really wanted to. So what did I do? I ran more or less a loop that requires me to run the whole thing in order to get back. No short cuts or stopping early. The distance was going to be the distance so I might as well run it.</p>\n<p>So for me, Treadmills &gt; Exercise Bikes when it comes to a mindless activity to get your body moving.</p>\n",

You will quickly find out in short drifting is just following along the status quo or coasting through life accepting everything that is happening.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large\"><p><i>“People do not decide their futures, they decide their habits and their habits decide their futures.”</i> </p><cite> <em>F.M. Alexander </em> </cite></blockquote>\n\n<p>As someone who has written about <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/02/19/power-of-the.html\">habits</a> before and not long ago had a very addicting habit that added up to <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/09/30/k-a-day.html\">a lot of miles being run</a>, I was very interested in seeing what the author had to say. Not too far into the book he hits you with some quick questions like <em>\"Are you feeling bored? Restless? Trapped?\"</em> and if your answers are yes then the solution is that <i><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">It's Time to Take Back Control of Your Life</span></i>.</p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell, that is what the book is really based on. The nice thing about this book, in my opinion, is that it is short and very consumable. However, not too short that he doesn't add some examples throughout each topic. However, It is really broken down into 4 parts which have simple enough concepts:</p>\n\n<h3>Awakening</h3>\n\n<p>Being aware as you cannot change what you are not aware of. Uncover the habits that are operating in your blind spots. Once your habits are brought out into light you can inspect them and disrupt them.</p>\n\n<h3>Disrupting</h3>\n\n<p>Disrupting is the process of interrupting your perpetual patterns and breaking the stimulus and response cycle. When you do this, you get immediate and profound feedback on why you do what you do, and how these habits may be serving or oppressing you.</p>\n\n<h3>Designing</h3>\n\n<p>The first two parts of the book are pretty straightforward as he talks about how to pretty much break down your current habits and thinking in order to get to the designing part. In the designing chapter he talks a lot about Ultimate authority and how to set compelling goals. This is where he talks about creating new habits that empower your future.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><i>Ultimate authority means taking responsibility for the fact that your life is the sum total of every decision you’ve ever made from the day you were born up until this very moment. This means you get to take credit for the many successes you’ve had. It also means the shit parts of your life are on you too.</i></p></blockquote>\n\n<h3>Sustaining</h3>\n\n<p>The part of the book I think makes the most sense. Obviously, if you have completed the above topics then you have to figure out a way to keep moving forward.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><i><b>The Awakening, Disrupting and Designing (ADD) Cycle we have just walked through in this book is a process that should be repeated and not a one-time exercise.</b></i></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>The above statement by the author was a great strategic point to make towards the end of the book for a reminder about sustaining. There are a lot of things we do in life thinking if we just do it once all is good. However, in reality, we need to continue to work on things no matter if it is trying to rid ourselves of excess possessions, weight, or anything else. Each day is a new day that you really have to tackle the problem again. The advantage you have as you build up the consecutive days is that it becomes a habit and less you might have to think about in the future.</p>\n\n<h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>\n\n<p>Overall, I enjoyed the book and if anything it made me think about various things I do and maybe things I have been thinking about changing or doing in my life but haven’t taken that next step. I really did enjoy that the book was a quick read as I could see myself flipping through the pages again at some point in time as it gives off a measure of motivation too.</p>\n\n<p>If you think the book would be interesting to you, it can be found on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077K9J6PT\">Amazon</a> or through the publisher’s website (<a href=\"https://www.tckpublishing.com/\">TCK Publishing</a>).</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's Your Ship: Management Techniques from the Best Damn Ship in the Navy by Captain D. Michael Abrashoff is a really good book if you are ever contemplating a management position or are currently in a management position. The story does a great job laying out examples of how Captain Abrashoff took a poor performing ship in the navy to become one of the sought after ships people wanted to be assigned to.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":51123417,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"custom\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Its-Your-Ship-Management-Techniques-ebook/dp/B001HPW9R4/?tag=stthink-20\"><img src=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/uploads/2021/3afb243583.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-51123417\"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Even though most of the concepts are not new in this book nor do I think the author claimed that the methods he used were entirely his own. I do think how he accomplished them is very interesting and sheds some light on how he thought about things differently during his command. In fact, many of his stories are how he tried doing something one way only to talk through and come up with a better way. It goes to show you that he too was learning through the process from day one.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><b><em>Of course, trying something new is never easy. For one thing, there aren’t any precedents to guide you. And that can be a very good thing.</em></b></p><cite>Captain D. Michael Abrashoff</cite></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, as much as I enjoyed the book I feel how it was laid out did not necessarily flow as well as I would have liked as I feel he repeated himself from time to time. The reason for that is obvious as he was breaking down chapters into Management topics and not in the chronological order that events happened. It is just something to think about as sometimes I was trying to figure out in what order he started to do certain things or implementing new tactics.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Takeaways</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Different than some of my other book reviews I am going to just write out a couple of notes I took that may or may not be helpful to you. Now as I mentioned the book is very focused from a managers prespective. However, the notes I took could be turned inward as well. Depending on your line of business or work you do because in all honesty aren’t we kind of an employee even if it is for ourselves?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As I read the book the following themes stuck out to me that could be used in any situation depending on how you read it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Lead by Example</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This seems to go without saying. Can you actually do what you are asking others to do? Also, if you got different results than you were expecting to ask yourself his simple questions:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>Did I clearly articulate the goals?</li><li>Did I give people enough time and resources to accomplish the task?</li><li>Did I give them enough training?</li><li>Listen Aggressively</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Abrashoff got personal in his discussions with the crew while learning about their personal lives, why they joined the Navy and their thoughts on how to improve the ship. By taking the time to listen and not just give orders he discovered that he had a crew of smart, talented, and innovative men and women, but they weren’t being heard. This can be true in many interactions today, sometimes the best thing to do is listen to the other people instead of making sure your voice is heard. You might find something out that can be more beneficial to your purpose or goal.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Communicate with Purpose</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>No matter how fantastic your message is, if no one is receiving it, you aren’t communicating. It is up to you to clearly define the mission and vision of the organization and then to communicate clearly and concisely.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Take risks</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Everyone in an organization must feel comfortable taking calculated risks. The key is to know the parameters in which they can take those calculated risks and that everyone understands that you might not always win. Remember to not over encourage perfection as it will limit your ability to think creatively and take risks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Praise</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As a manager myself I found this one spot on with his quote.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><i><b>Show me a manager that ignores the power of praise and I will show you a lousy manager, praise is infinitely more powerful than punishment.</b></i></p><cite>Captain D. Michael Abrashoff</cite></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, as with most of these points above, the simple act of giving praise to someone even if you don’t have a working relationship as the book describes can go a long way. There are a lot of people putting stuff out there and the act of giving recognition might seem small for you but 100x the effect for the person receiving it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I would recommend this book as I found it an interesting read with a couple of good takeaways.  I don't think this book is for everyone as some of the takeaways can be found in other books. However, I enjoyed hearing the stories of how Captain Abrashoff achieved his success.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

However, as I looked at my watch and realized I was at about 2 miles into my run and approaching my house I thought why not just continue and run another 3.1 mile loop that goes a different direction.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So that is just what I did and I continued on a different route.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote {\"className\":\"is-style-default\"} -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p><i><b>“It’s not so much that I began to run, but that I continued”</b></i></p><cite>Hal Higdon</cite></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>You might be wondering why I shared the story above with you but stick with me and read on :)</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was glad to have extended my total run to the full 6.2 miles I had planned to run the night before.

In fact, we could miss a turn that might take us off the current route but still headed in the right direction overall.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This has happened to me quite a few times most specifically in careers or jobs. I know what I would like to be doing down the road from now or how that might look.

Then another year goes by and I realize I am no closer to where I would like to end up and in reality, I might be further behind or off track.

However, you should make sure you are aware of your surroundings and make sure you aren’t just following a path because that was your original plan. You also need to make sure you are keeping your head up and making sure you aren’t so focused on the trail in front of you that you might be passing up other opportunities.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

I know some companies have programs like actual sabbaticals after putting in a number of years at companies. I think the idea is great and I think it could be something done on a smaller scale too.

I have always taken time away to spend time with family and I would say I was “disconnecting” from work. However, I was never truly disconnected. I was still getting work emails on my phone and more often than not I carried my work laptop with me to where I was going. So in theory as much as I was saying I was “disconnected” I was still connected by checking and making sure nothing went wrong back at work while I was away. Even if I wasn’t responding to anything, I was still glancing through things to make sure nothing big was going on and filling stuff away in order to make it easier for when I got back to work.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>However, on this “break” I didn’t have email or work issues that came up or even could be brought my attention.
