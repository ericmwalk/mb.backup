Pattern Storehouse</a> that I only breilfy wrote about before.</p>\n<p>So when I saw the picture above on my flight home, I decided to spend some time with this wonderful Free High Speed Delta WiFi while watching movies to do a little digging about the <a href=\"https://www.portlandlandmarks.org/observatory\">Portland Observatory</a>.

				"content_text": "Running the other day I ran by the [Portland Observatory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Observatory) which is on my list to actual goto when it is open but I haven't had a chance as it isn't open year round. \n\n![A tall, red lighthouse stands against a cloudy sky, surrounded by residential buildings and parked vehicles.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2024/img-8882.jpeg)\n\nI find older cities and towns fascinating as the town I live in doesn't have the same type of historical story or maybe more specifically not as many older buildings still being used today. Granted there is history where I live but not to the same extent as Portland, ME (or other places). There is so many buildings I see during my wandering around Portland that I wonder what it originally was used for and all of that just like the Portland [Hey Building](https://ericmwalk.blog/2024/03/05/decided-to-hit.html) and [Portland Co. Pattern Storehouse](https://ericmwalk.blog/2023/03/06/photoblogging-day-this.html) that I only breilfy wrote about before.\n\nSo when I saw the picture above on my flight home, I decided to spend some time with this wonderful Free High Speed Delta WiFi while watching movies to do a little digging about the [Portland Observatory](https://www.portlandlandmarks.org/observatory).

				"content_html": "<p>In my <a href=\"https://www.thingelstad.com/2023/09/04/blog-gardening.html\">blog gardening</a> <em>(thank you <a href=\"https://www.thingelstad.com/\">Jamie</a> I am stealing your term)</em> I have stumbled across when I was in Germany for two weeks for work back in 2018. Granted I only have a handful of pictures that are in this blog and most of them came through my Instagram import I did a while back.</p>\n<p>However, as I have been cleaning up some of the posts I see by adding the location of where the picture was shot for reference (thanks to Google Location Tracking), it has got me thinking should I take a little bit of extra time and recreate some events on my site? Maybe more specifically at a minimum, recreate or document places we visited and saw as I did for my family Trip out East and around Superior a couple years back (note you will not find it on the site yet as I kept track and never could figure out how I wanted to publish it). I do wish I did a better job of keeping track of those types of events or trips prior to the past year or so.</p>\n<p>I was talking to my uncle the other day and my Grandfather (his dad) who was an accountant and had to bill his time to his clients by the hour kept record of pretty much everything he did but in very brief formats. He had a paper journal book for every year that would lay out people he met with and events in his life. For example, I saw the entry of where my mom was born (they wrote a different name than was hers so I guess they changed it later) in the morning and then in the afternoon it seems my grandfather had to go back to work as he then billed a client a handful of hours working on something. He also wrote down how much everything cost which was interesting to see that back then it only cost $18 for delivery and two nights in the hospital.

				"content_text": "In my [blog gardening](https://www.thingelstad.com/2023/09/04/blog-gardening.html) *(thank you [Jamie](https://www.thingelstad.com/) I am stealing your term)* I have stumbled across when I was in Germany for two weeks for work back in 2018. Granted I only have a handful of pictures that are in this blog and most of them came through my Instagram import I did a while back. \n\nHowever, as I have been cleaning up some of the posts I see by adding the location of where the picture was shot for reference (thanks to Google Location Tracking), it has got me thinking should I take a little bit of extra time and recreate some events on my site? Maybe more specifically at a minimum, recreate or document places we visited and saw as I did for my family Trip out East and around Superior a couple years back (note you will not find it on the site yet as I kept track and never could figure out how I wanted to publish it). I do wish I did a better job of keeping track of those types of events or trips prior to the past year or so.\n\nI was talking to my uncle the other day and my Grandfather (his dad) who was an accountant and had to bill his time to his clients by the hour kept record of pretty much everything he did but in very brief formats. He had a paper journal book for every year that would lay out people he met with and events in his life. For example, I saw the entry of where my mom was born (they wrote a different name than was hers so I guess they changed it later) in the morning and then in the afternoon it seems my grandfather had to go back to work as he then billed a client a handful of hours working on something. He also wrote down how much everything cost which was interesting to see that back then it only cost $18 for delivery and two nights in the hospital. Not sure how much insurance covers then but that is a shocking number compared to even what it cost for my kids 9-14 years ago. \n\nI think of all that work he used to do journaling briefly moments of his life and I wish I had something similar but I do get caught up in that do I capture enough or do I capture too much. However, I just wrote out a paragraph of text explaining the couple of sentences I saw and could piece it together and found it interesting.\n\nNow granted this day and age we even have the further benefits of quickly adding photos, GPS tracking, and stuff other data that could be easily included to our events in our life.

However, on a whim and looking at weather forecasts in November I quickly decided to put the boards up and then order a tarp from a new company. Then the weather started to get warm and I waited.... and waited... Like I have done since learning that valuable lesson in my earlier years. However, fast forward to today and it is December 27th and the weather may maybe getting close to the right conditions as you can see from my chart below but I am asking myself a very important question. Am I going to finish building the rink for the 2023-2024 Season?\r\n\r\nSuch a hard questions as I have a streak going of 9 years and not to mention a good handful of the work is already done with the [boards up](https://ericmwalk.blog/2023/11/17/well-decisions-were.html).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2023/weather-outlook.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"606\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\nI guess I always do say never say never so who knows maybe in the last moment I will change my mind but I don't think so as of right now. I don't take it lightly though breaking a good streak right before a round number but this winter is not what I would have expected and once January 2nd hits everyone will be busy again as normally between Christmas and New Year is when we use the rink the most. Hopefully, looking forward to the 2024-2025 season as I will still have the tarp now and should be ready to go. Guess I will have to (unless I change my mind) since everything is purchased and only labor is needed.\n",

Yes from an education perspective where we live is a great place to be but,  growing up for me I loved playing sports too. To be fair I just liked playing sports to hang out with friends but also because I just liked doing things. True some sports I was probably more ‚Äúin it to win it‚Äù focused than others but overall I could do them all and that isn‚Äôt because I was a stellar athlete. Running sure, I worked hard after my Freshman and Sophomore years to make sure I was one of our top runners for cross country and found a niche for myself in track running 800s and 400s.</p>\n<p>However, this isn‚Äôt just a story about my memories yet I should in my future right more of them down so when I am old I won‚Äôt forget. This is a story about my kids, but more specifically my oldest who found out tonight that he did not make a Freshman team üòî. I had a feeling this day would come as he was mostly always on the 3 team out of 4 for Travel basketball and once you hit Freshman year they only take 2 teams ~18-20 kids out of the 64 that tried out this year. Granted other years my son in theory was in the top 18-27 (as they took 9 to a team) so it wasn‚Äôt that there wasn‚Äôt a chance but he had a hill to climb as you also get new kids coming out or kids that moved into the district. So here we are today and the die has been cast unfortunately not in his favor.</p>\n<p>It isn‚Äôt to say that the kid can‚Äôt still play basketball but it isn‚Äôt the same, I can still play basketball today but that is not like playing in High School. I was able to do that because I lived in a small school and I was not by any means a good basketball player. I only stopped playing voluntarily before my Senior year because I wanted to lift and run so I was ready for my last time on a track the following spring (I might have felt good about my running but I knew my career would be over in High School). The other thing that bothers me in today‚Äôs youth sports world and maybe it isn‚Äôt just at a big school but you have to specialize early on. They say they want multisport athletes but then there are camps year round that you have the ‚Äúopportunity‚Äù to attend and you end up devoting yourself to that sport with never a guarantee that there is a spot for you down the road. Not saying it is right but if at HS age they then said hey you are on the team and now this is your only focus, maybe that would make more sense or I would feel better about such a thing even though I still don‚Äôt agree with that. However, it is still so hard for me to comprehend as it was never an issue for me and back when I was younger we played a sport a season not one sport for our youth career. That is something I have disliked during my kids time growing up it seems like kids do benefit from doing it year round but that still isn‚Äôt a guarantee that everyone will still thrive by doing it year round because you never know what kind of camps or coaches you get in the offseason to push you forward.</p>\n<p>It is still crazy to me to think of all the kids that got cut today and I would say probably 10-15 of those kids if they were in a smaller school most likely would have had a shot to continue to play in High School in front of a crowd of people on a Friday night.  However, now all of these kids have swag ball, which from what I can tell is like a pickup game of basketball on the weekend which kind of sounds like something I could be a candidate for today. Well, probably not as I am not that tall or still not very good (maybe worse).</p>\n<p>Proud of all my son had one over all his years of basketball and I just hope he knows that it is not the end of playing as this is just a setback. I know it will take him some time to get excited about it again as I am sure it is tough as he needs to process all the feelings. However, there are other options just probably not the one he was hoping for and in the end, basketball is one of those things he can continue to do for quite a long time at his age.</p>\n",

Some are actual questions I am pondering and probably need to look for advice from others that have similar issues (e.g., kids backups) and then others are just random things I am thinking about today. It might be the early morning hour I woke up, got a run in and have consumed a fair amount of coffee.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the best approach to backup all of my kids phone and computers (only 1 has one at this time)?</li>\n<li>Should I change up how I store photos and where I have my backups? I think I have about 4 places right now all in and videos are still a wild card.</li>\n<li>Note-taking is still a mess as to where I put what but I have downsized one by one by finally getting rid of Evernote but also increased one by starting to use Bear now as well ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</li>\n<li>File storage, probably should shift to just one platform as I have some in Google Drive and now some in iCloud.</li>\n<li>I should really sign up for some sort of running race this year but leaning towards just a fun trail run.</li>\n<li>Is there any more consolidation I should do on my Social Media or Online presence side of things?</li>\n<li>Should I sell my iPad mini as I don‚Äôt know if I get enough value out of it today or what could do or use it for more?</li>\n<li>I need to get back to being a more morning person as I enjoy those quiet hours in the morning before everything gets crazy.</li>\n<li>Next time I take more than one day off I think I need to block off about 1/2 my morning on my first day back to just get back k up to speed (assuming I stepped away and didn‚Äôt keep checking email and working on break). I think that would help make the meeting later in the day or early the next more productive.</li>\n<li>When posting a picture to Micro.blog should I have it posted in Markdown or HTML?</li>\n<li>It would be nice from time to time e to tag a location in Micro.blog I feel like at one point there had been talk about that but I might be misremembering.

				"content_text": "These things have been swirling around in my mind all day. Some are actual questions I am pondering and probably need to look for advice from others that have similar issues (e.g., kids backups) and then others are just random things I am thinking about today. It might be the early morning hour I woke up, got a run in and have consumed a fair amount of coffee.\n\n - What is the best approach to backup all of my kids phone and computers (only 1 has one at this time)?\n - Should I change up how I store photos and where I have my backups? I think I have about 4 places right now all in and videos are still a wild card.\n - Note-taking is still a mess as to where I put what but I have downsized one by one by finally getting rid of Evernote but also increased one by starting to use Bear now as well ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n - File storage, probably should shift to just one platform as I have some in Google Drive and now some in iCloud.\n - I should really sign up for some sort of running race this year but leaning towards just a fun trail run.\n - Is there any more consolidation I should do on my Social Media or Online presence side of things?\n - Should I sell my iPad mini as I don‚Äôt know if I get enough value out of it today or what could do or use it for more?\n - I need to get back to being a more morning person as I enjoy those quiet hours in the morning before everything gets crazy.\n - Next time I take more than one day off I think I need to block off about 1/2 my morning on my first day back to just get back k up to speed (assuming I stepped away and didn‚Äôt keep checking email and working on break). I think that would help make the meeting later in the day or early the next more productive.\n - When posting a picture to Micro.blog should I have it posted in Markdown or HTML?\n - It would be nice from time to time e to tag a location in Micro.blog I feel like at one point there had been talk about that but I might be misremembering. I know there is shortcuts I can use to get a link in there but would be nice to make it more streamlined.\n - Wouldn‚Äôt it be great if it was easier to use Focus modes on Apple devices?

				"title": "Why I Post My Runs",
				"content_html": "<p>It might seem silly that I do this as I am sure some people might get sick of seeing a photo every other day or so with a link to Strava and some random thoughts of my run. I used to just post a photo on Instagram long before I stumbled on Micro.blog as most of the time back then my runs were early morning or in the evening and I enjoyed sharing a good sunrise or sunset photo. After I finished my 5k a day I think I stopped posting photos there and then it became more infrequent and only if I would find something interesting. Then I came to Micro.blog and after a while, I started posting running photos here but again infrequent and would never link to Strava until about a year ago. For some reason, I got this idea in my head that not only would I want a photo from my run with some random thoughts but a link to the route I did, which would tell me where I was also. I am sure no one else could care but it is my blog and a good way to document things to remember even though I wasn&rsquo;t sure when I would look back. Until the other day, I finished my run and clicked on the On This Day link I have and found out I ran the same tails a year ago!</p>\n<p><em>Run from Last week <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2023/07/06/trails-convinced-my.html\">Thursday July 6, 2023</a> and then my run from <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2022/07/06/really-nice-evening.html\">Thursday July 6, 2022</a>. Kind of interesting I thought.</em></p>\n<p>I know that in theory, Strava can capture the same information but that information is stored in a place that I can‚Äôt easily export and keep for the long run.

				"content_text": "It might seem silly that I do this as I am sure some people might get sick of seeing a photo every other day or so with a link to Strava and some random thoughts of my run. I used to just post a photo on Instagram long before I stumbled on Micro.blog as most of the time back then my runs were early morning or in the evening and I enjoyed sharing a good sunrise or sunset photo. After I finished my 5k a day I think I stopped posting photos there and then it became more infrequent and only if I would find something interesting. Then I came to Micro.blog and after a while, I started posting running photos here but again infrequent and would never link to Strava until about a year ago. For some reason, I got this idea in my head that not only would I want a photo from my run with some random thoughts but a link to the route I did, which would tell me where I was also. I am sure no one else could care but it is my blog and a good way to document things to remember even though I wasn't sure when I would look back. Until the other day, I finished my run and clicked on the On This Day link I have and found out I ran the same tails a year ago!\n\n*Run from Last week [Thursday July 6, 2023](https://ericmwalk.blog/2023/07/06/trails-convinced-my.html) and then my run from [Thursday July 6, 2022](https://ericmwalk.blog/2022/07/06/really-nice-evening.html). Kind of interesting I thought.*\n\nI know that in theory, Strava can capture the same information but that information is stored in a place that I can‚Äôt easily export and keep for the long run.

They told us during Christmas 2021, that they would rather spend some of the money we would maybe get in the future today together as a family. I mean how can you say no to that logic. Additionally, they made it super clear to my brother and I that they wanted to pay for our tickets, rental car, and the house that we would all be staying together at. It was super generous of them but also gave all of us an excuse to go hang out at the beach, play mini-golf, take nature hikes and just spend quality time with us away from all the busyness of our own lives.

This was one of the best and dumbest decisions we have made. The dumbest because the only spot available was an RV only spot which is perfect because we have an RV but also the most expensive. To add to that this is also during a summer we knew we would not be there for about 4 weeks out of it with the other trips (at a minimum). However, seeing how much fun the kids had spending free weeks there was great as well. I think this will have a short shelf life as our kids are getting older so we figured we would strike while the iron is hot.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2023/69de9d0873.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Tagging along right with that we sold our beloved <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2022/09/28/goodbye-rv.html\">RV</a>.

So we sold it and found someone onsite selling their travel trailer for a good price.

The crazy thing is how this came about and really this is where embracing conversations and past connections really pays off.

				"content_html": "<p>About 14 years ago I started what was an ongoing process for the next 4-5 years of removing most of the paper clutter in my life and either moving things to a digital format if I wanted to keep them or I just got rid of it. The first big chunk of that stuff was old financial statements. I remember finding a bank statement I had from the year I was born. I mean really was that something I needed anymore? The short answer was no as it was beyond any amount of time that I would need to look back and in addition, I had long since closed that account too <em>(that is another story of frustration with a local bank charging a poor college kid fees)</em>.</p>\n<p>Now that I have moved almost all of my paper goods to digital I have realized that my digital life is kind of a mess. When I first started with a more digital approach I would just scan paper items in and save them on my computer. However, then I found Evernote and started to use that as a big repository of documents as it supported PDFs and was easy enough to organize.  However, fast forward to a couple of years ago when I got a Samsung tablet and I then thought with this handwritten support in OneNote I should move everything there. Then I moved on from <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/08/20/new-devices.html\">Android</a> and went all in on iOS devices so it made sense to use a different app I quickly gravitated to the Notes app and I moved things to DayOne for archival purposes as well. However, as luck would have it at my new job I can&rsquo;t access the Apple Notes app because they block logging into iCloud and I don&rsquo;t have a Mac either which makes it more difficult. So I was on the hunt again for something that can play nice with all my devices so I have been giving Craft a try.</p>\n<p>Now that we are in a new year, I am trying to figure out the best approach going forward. However, I need to break it down into some categories because as much as I would love to have everything living in one place I just don&rsquo;t think that makes sense anymore.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Kids Stuff</strong></em> - This can be anything from pictures they create at school, papers, newspaper articles about them or their team, vacation stuff they want to remember either written or spoken, and stuff from events (e.g., programs, stats, certificates).  For the last 2 years this has been kept in DayOne and I think that is the best place to keep it going forward. I have a Journal for each kid and just drop stuff in there as we go. What makes this even better is that my wife is great at documenting our travels and life by taking pictures and posting them for family and friends on Instagram. I have her account get sucked into DayOne as well so not only can we see pictures and stuff from when our kids were doing something but also the remember this day might show artwork or something else from the kids.</li>\n<li><em><strong>Household / Financial Stuff</strong></em> - Broad category here as I am going to toss in receipts, anything for Taxes,  and warranties as well. Maybe this category should be broken out but in the past, both of these things have lived together in Evernote, then OneNote, and now some have started to find it&rsquo;s the way in Notes. This is the one place that has been bumped around all over the place and I am not really sure where to have it live going forward. Now that I have been using Craft more I debate putting it in there as I feel like I could create a Workspace that has just one or the other in there. However, there is the thought that I need to keep less financial stuff lately as almost all the places I use to keep an online history for more years than I need. However, I would still need a place to keep donation receipts and other miscellaneous receipts / statements as well. No real solution for myself right now but this is an area of focus for me.</li>\n<li><em><strong>Work Stuff</strong></em> - This is a strange one as I don&rsquo;t really need most of this stuff long-term but I have been really struggling with where to put work notes / items to follow up on. Quick disclaimer, at my current company we use Windows machines and the Google Suite of apps. Oh, and our computers are really locked down. So where I used to take notes in OneNote for work I then was going to start up with Apple Notes but then had no way to access them at my current job. So I have found myself using Craft. The unfortunate thing here is I can not install the Windows Application but have to do everything in the web app. It is good so I am not complaining but now I have started to use a real notebook again to capture those quick things and quickly draw something out. So I am left with a really fragmented work note-keeping area. The only saving grace here is that I typically don&rsquo;t need a lot of the stuff for years. It is in the realm of writing something to quickly reference it for about a 1 year period but not after that.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So not only am I trying to figure out the best way to keep things going forward the bigger part of this that isn&rsquo;t addressed is what do do with everything else. I havn&rsquo;t even started on one-off digital pictures, random files (e.g., Word, Excel, Text), and everything else that people accumulate while using computers over their lifetime. I am not sure why but it is harder for me to toss out a random document or digital item vs how quickly I was able to do it with old paper / physical stuff I had. I used to save all my financial statements and file them away in folders on my computer which now just lives on a home server. Again, most of those statements are at places I no longer have accounts or pay statements from places I don&rsquo;t work anymore (10+ years ago).</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t have a specific solution today but curious what others do as I attempt to get a better process as well as clean up older digital clutter in 2023.</p>\n",

It is in the realm of writing something to quickly reference it for about a 1 year period but not after that.\n\nSo not only am I trying to figure out the best way to keep things going forward the bigger part of this that isn't addressed is what do do with everything else. I havn't even started on one-off digital pictures, random files (e.g., Word, Excel, Text), and everything else that people accumulate while using computers over their lifetime. I am not sure why but it is harder for me to toss out a random document or digital item vs how quickly I was able to do it with old paper / physical stuff I had. I used to save all my financial statements and file them away in folders on my computer which now just lives on a home server. Again, most of those statements are at places I no longer have accounts or pay statements from places I don't work anymore (10+ years ago).\n\nI don't have a specific solution today but curious what others do as I attempt to get a better process as well as clean up older digital clutter in 2023.\n\n",

I jumped on board and actually became a paying member as I wanted to really give this a go. I think the things that really piqued my interest is that it really could be a one-stop shop for reading, and saving information. Having the integration built right into the RSS feed so that you can quickly save things for later that end up in an Inbox is kind of what I have tried to do with my various tools. Also, if I just happen to be browsing around on the web I can use their browser extensions (or iOS Apps) to save it into my queue. Then I have one place to find all of this stuff instead of finding an interesting link and putting it in a Read later service that I don't access enough.

However, here is a couple:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>RSS Reader Views/Categories</strong> - The UI for the current RSS reader as it is a little clunky in my opinion. I like to bucket my RSS feeds into various things depending on what I want to catch up on (e.g., Friends' Blogs, News, YouTube Videos, Runners üòâ). It isn't that this is not possible in Readwise Reader as you can do like I did and move things to Views. Though it is very clunky to setup as I have to touch all of my feeds again to assign them. I am sure this might be something that will change in the future but really the heavy lift will be from the initial import as I had a lot of feeds. So I guess if you are starting from scratch this would be easier. However, if Views are the way to go I would like a view that shows anything unassigned to a view as I used to use a Category like that in FreshRSS for Feeds I was kind of giving a trial before I sorted them out.</li>\n<li><strong>JSON Feeds</strong> - I am really hoping they will support this because my current FreshRSS Reader doesn't allow for this and since I get some of my reading from Micro.blog I would like to be able to subscribe to the Discovery feed.

Last night I was digging into the &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; way to consume information (e.g., blog posts, articles, news) and also how to retain the interesting parts of any of that or save the link for another point in time. I feel like there is not a 100% solution I have seen and maybe that is where my expectations are to high or maybe what I am looking for is not what everyone else needs. I don&rsquo;t mind using multiple tools to get the job done but sometimes trying to get the information from one to the next is more friction than it is worth and that is what I am trying to change. However, this is my current cobbled together parts that I am using <em>(I might even be missing something)</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://freshrss.org/\"><strong>FreshRSS</strong></a> - This is really where anything I would like to subscribe to comes in and I will triage it from here (or using Reeder on iOS). It is the current firehose of information that I have cobbled even newsletters to come in through various other means. In fact, synced up <a href=\"http://feedland.org/\">Feedland</a> feeds in there which has been interesting (more on that later).  When using just the Web version, I was able to create a quick button next to the feed item that I can send it directly to Wallabag (see below) without having to click multiple items to get it to share to it behind the scenes. I wish I could do more of these little changes as it might help my overall simplification.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag\">Wallabag </a>- Really just a self-hosted read-it-later service that I like the idea of and probably won&rsquo;t remove it yet but it lacks some of the other features that I would really like in a read-it-later service or place to archive information. My biggest issue after being pointed to Matter is that the voice-to-text on this is garbage right now. If that could be improved I might try to send more stuff in this direction as it does have a really good link with my FreshRSS instance. Their iOS app isn&rsquo;t great either but I can overlook some of that if other things would work better and be more fluid.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli\"><strong>Shaarli</strong></a> - Originally this was just a place to save links as a reference for later. I used it for a little while to share links I found out to Micro.blog but the one frustration was that I couldn&rsquo;t easily add a blurb or anything about it. There is a notes field but that doesn&rsquo;t translate over to get sucked into my Micro.blog. However, on the plus side, I can quickly add things to this app via the Web or iOS so I want to still use it but it has but one purpose.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://kill-the-newsletter.com/\"><strong>Kill the Newsletter!</strong></a> - This is what I use to get newsletters into FreshRSS. I know some other apps have this built-in that I even use (i.e., Matter) but since ideally, I want everything to come into FreshRSS this was the best workaround I have found. I only have a handful that I use this for today as my preference would be to have an RSS feed from the site I subscribed to as most newsletters do today. However, this is a nice workaround for those that don&rsquo;t have that option. With that said some of the newsletters that come through don&rsquo;t look super pretty but to me it is nice to get it out of my Inbox.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://getmatter.com/\"><strong>Matter</strong> </a>- This is a little bit newer in my arsenal of information consumption apps. I actually really like it as it does read articles really well and also offers the highlighting of text and stuff to pull out later. I think the only grip I have is that at this point it is clunky in the grand scheme of my process. <em>I get it my process should change.</em> In order for me to get information in here it seems like too many clicks from where my information comes in (e.g., FreshRSS). Matter does now support RSS but I don&rsquo;t really want a firehose of information coming into this app as it doesn&rsquo;t appear to be designed to triage information.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://feedland.org/\"><strong>Feedland</strong></a> - Maybe this doesn&rsquo;t exactly fit in this write-up but it is something I have been using over the past two weeks since I noticed <a href=\"https://canion.blog/\">Andrew Canion</a> posted about it. I will be honest I am not 100% sure how to use it as I probably still need to tinker with it a little more but I do like that I have a bunch of news/posts I am following that I probably would have spent the time to find. That might be one of the benefits I am seeing since one of the feeds I have in there is the most popular feed or articles of all Feedland users. Probably more to come on this at another time if I keep using it and figure it out more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The final gripe is random but it fits in the realm of RSS feeds and mostly how I consume information.  For those of you that only send excerpts in your RSS please stop! Just let the whole post be in the RSS feed so everyone can have a great reading experience and not have to go to to your site to read the rest.  I have been using <a href=\"https://www.fivefilters.org/full-text-rss/\">FiveFilters Full-Text RSS</a>. I was using their self-hosted one for a few years now but I think it needs updating and I need to purchase a copy. I am not opposed but not sure I really need it and might just unsubscribe from those that go down the excerpt route vs allowing the RSS feed the full text üòâ.</p>\n<p><em>Note this was written in <a href=\"https://craft.do\">Craft</a> and in a spider web of connected processes arrived at my Micro.blog site.

It is the current firehose of information that I have cobbled even newsletters to come in through various other means. In fact, synced up [Feedland](http://feedland.org/) feeds in there which has been interesting (more on that later).  When using just the Web version, I was able to create a quick button next to the feed item that I can send it directly to Wallabag (see below) without having to click multiple items to get it to share to it behind the scenes. I wish I could do more of these little changes as it might help my overall simplification.\n- [Wallabag ](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag)- Really just a self-hosted read-it-later service that I like the idea of and probably won't remove it yet but it lacks some of the other features that I would really like in a read-it-later service or place to archive information. My biggest issue after being pointed to Matter is that the voice-to-text on this is garbage right now. If that could be improved I might try to send more stuff in this direction as it does have a really good link with my FreshRSS instance. Their iOS app isn't great either but I can overlook some of that if other things would work better and be more fluid.\n- [**Shaarli**](https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli) - Originally this was just a place to save links as a reference for later. I used it for a little while to share links I found out to Micro.blog but the one frustration was that I couldn't easily add a blurb or anything about it. There is a notes field but that doesn't translate over to get sucked into my Micro.blog. However, on the plus side, I can quickly add things to this app via the Web or iOS so I want to still use it but it has but one purpose.\n- [**Kill the Newsletter!**](https://kill-the-newsletter.com/) - This is what I use to get newsletters into FreshRSS. I know some other apps have this built-in that I even use (i.e., Matter) but since ideally, I want everything to come into FreshRSS this was the best workaround I have found. I only have a handful that I use this for today as my preference would be to have an RSS feed from the site I subscribed to as most newsletters do today. However, this is a nice workaround for those that don't have that option. With that said some of the newsletters that come through don't look super pretty but to me it is nice to get it out of my Inbox.\n- [**Matter** ](http://getmatter.com/)- This is a little bit newer in my arsenal of information consumption apps. I actually really like it as it does read articles really well and also offers the highlighting of text and stuff to pull out later. I think the only grip I have is that at this point it is clunky in the grand scheme of my process. *I get it my process should change.* In order for me to get information in here it seems like too many clicks from where my information comes in (e.g., FreshRSS). Matter does now support RSS but I don't really want a firehose of information coming into this app as it doesn't appear to be designed to triage information.\n- [**Feedland**](http://feedland.org/) - Maybe this doesn't exactly fit in this write-up but it is something I have been using over the past two weeks since I noticed [Andrew Canion](https://canion.blog/) posted about it. I will be honest I am not 100% sure how to use it as I probably still need to tinker with it a little more but I do like that I have a bunch of news/posts I am following that I probably would have spent the time to find. That might be one of the benefits I am seeing since one of the feeds I have in there is the most popular feed or articles of all Feedland users. Probably more to come on this at another time if I keep using it and figure it out more.\n\nThe final gripe is random but it fits in the realm of RSS feeds and mostly how I consume information.  For those of you that only send excerpts in your RSS please stop! Just let the whole post be in the RSS feed so everyone can have a great reading experience and not have to go to to your site to read the rest.  I have been using [FiveFilters Full-Text RSS](https://www.fivefilters.org/full-text-rss/). I was using their self-hosted one for a few years now but I think it needs updating and I need to purchase a copy. I am not opposed but not sure I really need it and might just unsubscribe from those that go down the excerpt route vs allowing the RSS feed the full text üòâ.\n\n*Note this was written in [Craft](https://craft.do) and in a spider web of connected processes arrived at my Micro.blog site. Hopefully!*\n\n",

Kind of like when I ran a <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/09/30/k-a-day.html\">5k a day for 365 days</a> as no one really knew much about it till the end. It wasn‚Äôt that I was hiding it but it was something that I wanted to prove to myself just like the 4x4x48.

				"content_text": "Another trip around the sun for me as I flip my internal digits to **41**! As I am sitting down in these morning hours, hoping the kids will sleep in longer as they are on Spring Break, I am actually struggling what to write. It isn‚Äôt that I don‚Äôt know what to write but there was actually a lot of things that happened and I know I won‚Äôt capture them all or well enough in this entry. I am still working from home for the most part which is a blessing some days and a curse other times.\n\nHowever, using past entries as a guide I will follow up on some things I alluded to last year and just talk about other things. \n\nYear two with the RV was much like the first but a little less camping this year as we didn‚Äôt know what to expect with kids camps and stuff coming back. We never made it on a real long roadtrip but we visited a couple new places and old ones. I will say even though it is a chore getting the rig ready and cleaned out it seems like once we are at a place everyone enjoyed their time.\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/6e697aede9.jpg)  \n*On the top of Mt. Tom in [Sibley State Park](https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/virtual_tour/sibley/dialup.html), MN¬†*\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/bc3587b574.jpg)  \n*Hanging out for much longer than I would have expected at the [Mississippi Headwaters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itasca_State_Park). Everyone enjoyed it!*\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/37e16a9444.jpg)  \n*Sometime just taking a step back and putting your kids in the right surroundings and they will wow you.*\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/6d01cd27df.jpg)  \n*Lainey Lou the Doodle loves camping and her favorite camp chair... Sorry humans!*\n\nIt was my 40th this past year I had some big things planned in the area of running.... The good thing is I did complete the [Twin Cities Marathon](https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/10/04/twin-cities-marathon.html) that I did 20 years ago that day which was just a fun accomplishment in my mind.\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/924e8a2dbb.jpg)  \n*My crew really supported me the whole way with cheers.. I loved it!*\n\nHowever, the second thing I had up my sleeves didn‚Äôt pan out which might have been for the best. I would have had limited time in between each event so it might have made that Marathon extra hard. However, I decided to embark on my own adventure of a 4x4x40 which I then decided to complete the entire [4x4x48](https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/21/xx-recap.html) (which involves running 4 miles ever 4 hours for 48 hours). \n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/c28aac39d4.jpg)  \n*Doing a 4x4x48 means sometimes you find yourself running at night in the snow/rain. It‚Äôs fun right?* \n\nIt was one of those fun accomplishments that I was doing for myself and no one knew but me so that made it all the more fun. Kind of like when I ran a [5k a day for 365 days](https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/09/30/k-a-day.html) as no one really knew much about it till the end. It wasn‚Äôt that I was hiding it but it was something that I wanted to prove to myself just like the 4x4x48. I am not really sure what this year will bring as I haven‚Äôt signed up for anything but I keep plugging along. If anything I am going to keep exploring as a good thing about being able to run further from my house is I find new places to explore. \n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/8b49f3fe50.jpg)  \n*Following some new to me paths in the Riley Creek Conservation Area*\n\nAs I looking forward to this next year, I am looking forward to traveling again.

A big thanks to to Papa Walker (my Dad) for being our in-person cheer squad while we watched via livestream from the girls‚Äô dance competition. *(Apologies to the dancers on stage as our group let out an audible cheer at the buzzer beating victory!!! üôâ)*\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/d6c24bae45.jpg)\n\n*7th Grade Tier 4 State Champions!*\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/5633cd10ab.jpg)\n\n*The baller himself, well done son!*\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/8eb3d336dc.jpg)\n\n*Papa Walker and Brecken*\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/61c7d678c1.jpg)\n\n*He shoots!*\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/f2cf0e3318.jpg)\n\n*Thankful for technology that allowed me to not be in the same place but still follow along*\n\nWhat a great way to end the season and it is sad that the season has now come to an end. It has been fun watching these boys play together. They had a very successful season (28-12) despite all the sicknesses, and injuries. As I was the official / unofficial stat keeper here are some interesting facts.\n\n- 1st Place in 3 tournaments\n- 2nd Place in 2 tournaments\n- 3rd Place in 1 tournaments\n- 40% shooting percentage vs opponents 35%\n- One tournament they only had 5 kids to play (no subs) and only lost one game\n- Out of the 40 games only two kids were at all of them (one being my son)\n\n\n",

				"title": "Getting Organized üóÉ",
				"content_html": "<p>I am not completely there yet but it seems a lot of my other projects as of lately have revolved around this idea of organizing things&hellip;</p>\n<p>This probably started back in early January when I went down the rabbit hole of getting all my old DVDs on a computer to use with Plex as a way to free up some shelf space in the basement. I don‚Äôt remember the last time we have used any of those DVDs except a very small handful we take along in the RV. However, since putting them all on the computer, I think we have watched 10 movies off there so far. The next step in this process was getting a better handle on our Picture organization too, it aligned nicely with the first project because we had to get more HD space and in that purchase, we got a <em>new</em> computer so everything needed to be transferred from the old drive. With the new computer, the nice advantage is I have been able to remotely log into it and it is fast enough that I could look through old stuff and organize other things to fit with the process we use now. In fact, our picture process has even changed since I first had thought about it so maybe I will expand on that at another time.</p>\n<p>Online organization, this I have written about before but I have really abandoned using my old blog / Instagram / Twitter and have doubled down on Mico.blog. I am happy with this change as I like everything in one place but I do find at times I might be over clutter the M.b timeline when I do some multiple posts from a weekend adventure. I like to toss a photo up to capture moments which is why a while back I mostly only used Instagram. I am still using it today but now I only use the app to follow some friends of mine that don‚Äôt really post anywhere else.</p>\n<p>The next endeavor might take me a little longer to get done but I want to find the right tool or process to help me get more organized or stay organized. The issue is that I have realized a lack of organization in my life over the last year but probably has been a little longer than that.

				"content_text": "I am not completely there yet but it seems a lot of my other projects as of lately have revolved around this idea of organizing things...\n\nThis probably started back in early January when I went down the rabbit hole of getting all my old DVDs on a computer to use with Plex as a way to free up some shelf space in the basement. I don‚Äôt remember the last time we have used any of those DVDs except a very small handful we take along in the RV. However, since putting them all on the computer, I think we have watched 10 movies off there so far. The next step in this process was getting a better handle on our Picture organization too, it aligned nicely with the first project because we had to get more HD space and in that purchase, we got a *new* computer so everything needed to be transferred from the old drive. With the new computer, the nice advantage is I have been able to remotely log into it and it is fast enough that I could look through old stuff and organize other things to fit with the process we use now. In fact, our picture process has even changed since I first had thought about it so maybe I will expand on that at another time.\n\nOnline organization, this I have written about before but I have really abandoned using my old blog / Instagram / Twitter and have doubled down on Mico.blog. I am happy with this change as I like everything in one place but I do find at times I might be over clutter the M.b timeline when I do some multiple posts from a weekend adventure. I like to toss a photo up to capture moments which is why a while back I mostly only used Instagram. I am still using it today but now I only use the app to follow some friends of mine that don‚Äôt really post anywhere else.\n\nThe next endeavor might take me a little longer to get done but I want to find the right tool or process to help me get more organized or stay organized. The issue is that I have realized a lack of organization in my life over the last year but probably has been a little longer than that.

Each will be great when they are done and all serve different purposes. Here they are in somewhat a specific order of events:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Micro.blog</strong> - I got this idea finally to try making Micro.blog my home for all Posts, and Pictures. This involved rolling up my old Website and then importing my Instagram photos. Both of the projects are ‚ÄúDone‚Äù in theory. However, there is a lot more clean-up than I anticipated so this will be an ongoing project for a while. I thought I had the website import done and cleaned up but now that I am still working on the Instagram stuff I am finding more that did not come through due to the issues I outlined in that <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2022/01/05/all-in-on.html\">post</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Plex.tv</strong> - I got this installed on an old Mac I have stashed away in the basement after hearing it come up from time to time in conversations from others. My first thought was to use it as an easier way to access Pictures and Videos I had stored on a central storage device in my house. We store all of our pictures and videos there (which is then backed up to Backblaze) but sometimes getting them back or finding them again is not as easy as it should be. File sharing is slow to display previews and standing in the laundry room to use the computer isn‚Äôt ideal either. So I have only added at this point the 2021 photo library we have as the scan on this old thing takes a while and I also need this computer to do other work <em>(see below)</em></li>\n<li><strong>DVDs</strong> (Part 1) - I got this crazy idea to clean out this DVD shelf that has too many DVDs of which never get used but you can see it in the background of all my WebEx calls. I realized that I could just box them up and put them away but some of them I realized I don‚Äôt have digitally and now that my kids are getting older I might want to watch with them. Unfortunately, before I started to box any of these up my wife reminded me that we do use the DVDs sometimes when we go Camping since streaming is not an option. Sometimes it is nice to have some on hand as a backup when it rains. Hoping there was a way to figure this all out I was reminded of an article from fellow Micro.blog friend Jason Burk describing how he created the <a href=\"https://burk.io/2021/creating-the-golden-set\">Golden Set</a> by converting his DVDs to MP4s. <strong>BINGO</strong> now I had a project. *Current status is after a couple trial and errors, I have done about 150 of our DVDs and I feel like I have a long way to go.</li>\n<li><strong>DVDs</strong> (Part 2) - Due to some of the trial and errors of the first project I dug out an old computer I had gotten long ago. Come to find out it would be the perfect DVD machine but I realized that it did not have windows on it and that sent me down a path of digging through old CDs to find some sort of Windows CDs from past systems. I did find an old copy of Windows 8 which was working fine until I couldn‚Äôt seem to get any updates to fix the mouse drivers and whatnot. The solution was going to be to buy Windows 10 (which I wasn‚Äôt excited about) but I found out I was eligible for a free Windows 10 upgrade. That all worked well but it took some time to get to that point.</li>\n<li><strong>Storage</strong> ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è&hellip; As you work through the above projects you can only guess this leads to the question of do you have enough storage for all of these DVDs that you are going to now make digital? The answer is NO.. No, I do not. However, this was going to be an issue before this project took off as a couple of months ago I realized my 4TB HD was getting within 100GB of reaching the end of its life. To me, that is too close. <em>I need to still figure this out in the meantime I had a 2TB removable drive that I am currently putting all the movies on after I pull them off the DVDs. However, I don‚Äôt want this to last too long as they are not getting backed up to Backblaze and that would be a pain to have to do it all over again.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Well hopefully some of these projects come to completion this week or throughout the next couple of weeks but I am sure they will drag on much longer than that.</p>\n",

The solution was going to be to buy Windows 10 (which I wasn‚Äôt excited about) but I found out I was eligible for a free Windows 10 upgrade. That all worked well but it took some time to get to that point.\n- **Storage** ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è... As you work through the above projects you can only guess this leads to the question of do you have enough storage for all of these DVDs that you are going to now make digital? The answer is NO.. No, I do not. However, this was going to be an issue before this project took off as a couple of months ago I realized my 4TB HD was getting within 100GB of reaching the end of its life. To me, that is too close. *I need to still figure this out in the meantime I had a 2TB removable drive that I am currently putting all the movies on after I pull them off the DVDs. However, I don‚Äôt want this to last too long as they are not getting backed up to Backblaze and that would be a pain to have to do it all over again.*\n\nWell hopefully some of these projects come to completion this week or throughout the next couple of weeks but I am sure they will drag on much longer than that.\n\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Two weeks ago I decided to set off on completing a <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/01/xx-running-challenge.html\">4x4x40</a> as part of some crazy ideas for my 40th birthday year. However, after I reached the 40 miles I felt like I really needed to continue as I figured at that point I might never do this again and get so close to hitting the real number and completing a 4x4x48 (run 4 miles every 4 hours for 48 hours). Maybe it helped that I was a bit sleep deprived at the time and not thinking clearly as I figured what was two more 4 mile runs at that point.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/d0d7eda4b0.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Since I posted after each of my runs with a short photo, time, and thought I will not rehash all of them. I don‚Äôt want to make light of this challenge as I think it was hard but the miles themselves weren‚Äôt the worst for me. Some of that could have been that I didn‚Äôt really have a pace per mile in mind. I obviously wasn‚Äôt going to try to run the fastest 4 miles I could every time. However, in my mind, I wanted to keep all of my averages per run under 9 min/miles. The biggest struggle for me during this challenge was trying to fit it in during a normal working day. Due to the weather forecast and maybe my last-minute planning, as it was December, I did it during the middle of a workweek. So I scheduled it out earlier in the week and pretty much created an appointment for myself every 4 hrs. It worked great the first day but the second day some things came up at work so I had to shrink down one of my 3 hr blocks of <em>recovery</em> and extend other ones. I still was able to get the run in that 4 hr bock but I wasn‚Äôt as consistently on the hour as I was the first day of running. In a way, I am wondering if working both days helped me keep my focus away from running and how tired I might have been as I was doing things I needed to do during the day. Then in the evenings I still helped get the kids to activities and stuff.</p>\n<p>Now obviously the lack of sleep is one thing but the worst time of runs for me was the 5am runs that I did. I think it is because after the late-night 1am run it always took me longer than anticipated to fall asleep. You would have thought I would have been tired enough to just get into the house and fall asleep. I am guessing that the kick of adrenaline that was in my body messed with allowing my brain to shut down at that time. So for both days by the time I would will myself to sleep and it would work I think I only got 1 hr before I would have to wake up at 5am to run. After that run, I would just start my day and didn‚Äôt try to get any more rest as my youngest gets on the bus at 7am.</p>\n<p>In the end, I have never run so many miles in two days. It ended up being 48.9 miles due to one run when I put my trust in a running friend who lead me astray by an extra mile. Those two days were more mileage than I had completed any week during my marathon training this past year. It was an interesting challenge as it took careful planning as I still worked and helped with kid activities like a normal day. It was just I ran every 4 hrs üòÅ. The day after I was done I felt pretty wiped out from most likely lack of sleep and over-exercise. Fast forward two weeks later and I am back on track. Maybe I will do another one of these challenges someday but probably no time soon. At least for the rest of this year, it will be back to the normal scheduled running for me.<br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h4 id=\"full-data-of-runs---links-to-posts-and-strava\">Full Data of Runs - Links to Posts and Strava</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/01/running-log-xx.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 1/10 (1:01 am)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6328757476\">4.02 miles at 8:39/mi pace, 36¬∞F üåß</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/01/183000.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 2/10 (5:02 am)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6329422080\">4.02 miles at 8:55/mi pace, 37¬∞F üåòüå•</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/01/184500.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 3/10 (9:00 am)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6330251888\">4.01 miles at 8:51/mi pace, 36¬∞F üå•</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/01/191500.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 4/10 (1:01 pm)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6331221972\">4.02 miles at 8:33/mi pace, 45¬∞F ‚òÅÔ∏è</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/01/193000.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 5/10 (4:41 pm)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6331966369\">4.02 miles at 8:59/mi pace, 50¬∞F üå•</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/01/214806.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 6/10 (7:57 pm)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6332480665\">4.01 miles at 8:31/mi pace, 48¬∞F üå•</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/02/running-log-xx.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 7/10 (1:02 am)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6332890004\">4.02 miles at 8:47/mi pace, 47¬∞F ‚òÅÔ∏è</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/02/055602.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 8/10 (5:04 am)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6333540689\">4.02 miles at 8:59/mi pace, 40¬∞F üåå</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/02/113029.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 9/10 (9:52 am)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6334553267\"> 4.02 miles at 8:35/mi pace, 38¬∞F ‚òÄÔ∏è</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/02/143306.html\">Running Log: 4x4x40 - 10/10 (12:58 pm)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6335309327\">4.69 miles at 8:06/mi pace, 45¬∞F ‚òÅÔ∏è</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/02/180000.html\">Running Log: 4x4x44 - 11/10 (4:46 pm)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6336063574\">4.03 miles at 8:27/mi pace, 41¬∞F ‚òÅÔ∏è</a></em></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/02/220254.html\">Running Log: 4x4x48 - 12/10 (8:51 pm)</a></strong> - <em><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/6336606100\">4.03 miles at 8:35/mi pace, 39¬∞F üåß</a></em></li>\n</ul>\n",
				"content_text": "Two weeks ago I decided to set off on completing a [4x4x40](https://ericmwalk.blog/2021/12/01/xx-running-challenge.html) as part of some crazy ideas for my 40th birthday year. However, after I reached the 40 miles I felt like I really needed to continue as I figured at that point I might never do this again and get so close to hitting the real number and completing a 4x4x48 (run 4 miles every 4 hours for 48 hours). Maybe it helped that I was a bit sleep deprived at the time and not thinking clearly as I figured what was two more 4 mile runs at that point.\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/d0d7eda4b0.jpg)\n\nSince I posted after each of my runs with a short photo, time, and thought I will not rehash all of them. I don‚Äôt want to make light of this challenge as I think it was hard but the miles themselves weren‚Äôt the worst for me. Some of that could have been that I didn‚Äôt really have a pace per mile in mind. I obviously wasn‚Äôt going to try to run the fastest 4 miles I could every time. However, in my mind, I wanted to keep all of my averages per run under 9 min/miles. The biggest struggle for me during this challenge was trying to fit it in during a normal working day. Due to the weather forecast and maybe my last-minute planning, as it was December, I did it during the middle of a workweek. So I scheduled it out earlier in the week and pretty much created an appointment for myself every 4 hrs. It worked great the first day but the second day some things came up at work so I had to shrink down one of my 3 hr blocks of _recovery_ and extend other ones. I still was able to get the run in that 4 hr bock but I wasn‚Äôt as consistently on the hour as I was the first day of running. In a way, I am wondering if working both days helped me keep my focus away from running and how tired I might have been as I was doing things I needed to do during the day. Then in the evenings I still helped get the kids to activities and stuff.\n\nNow obviously the lack of sleep is one thing but the worst time of runs for me was the 5am runs that I did. I think it is because after the late-night 1am run it always took me longer than anticipated to fall asleep. You would have thought I would have been tired enough to just get into the house and fall asleep. I am guessing that the kick of adrenaline that was in my body messed with allowing my brain to shut down at that time. So for both days by the time I would will myself to sleep and it would work I think I only got 1 hr before I would have to wake up at 5am to run. After that run, I would just start my day and didn‚Äôt try to get any more rest as my youngest gets on the bus at 7am.\n\nIn the end, I have never run so many miles in two days. It ended up being 48.9 miles due to one run when I put my trust in a running friend who lead me astray by an extra mile. Those two days were more mileage than I had completed any week during my marathon training this past year.

I had actually never run on this trail before so even though the map said it was going to end sometimes things aren‚Äôt updated that well and I was thinking it might have gone further. So it did surprise me when I came to the end and the path did not go further or connect up to anything else. I am guessing it is because if they wanted to keep extending it South they would have to figure out how to go over or under HWY-212.</p>\n<p>Overall, it was really nice trail that was all asphalt so I might have to remember this one for next summer with the kids as the distance isn‚Äôt to crazy either.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em><strong>Update</strong>: Since I didn‚Äôt post this yesterday as planned, I dug into some of the old Chanhassen park records and it seems like the Master Park / Trail plans from 2017 and 2018 assumed they would continue it further South. I wonder if once the construction of HWY-212 was completed they just abandoned the original plan or maybe didn‚Äôt leave a passage to get under it.

				"content_text": "Decided to follow a [trail](https://www.strava.com/activities/6267437384) with 6 tunnels yesterday along the 3.4 mile [Bluff Creek Local Trail](https://onthegomap.com/s/t0pshhke) in Chanhassen üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/e22c25d7d6.jpg)\n\nW 78th St Tunnel _(the start of the trail)_\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/205384dc28.jpg)\n\nArboretum Blvd Tunnel _(It is really two tunnels as you can see the space in the center but really only one road so I am counting it as one)_\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/75ebf43d4e.jpg)\n\nCoulter Blvd Tunnel\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/9b2552b300.jpg)\n\nTwin Cities & Western Railroad Tunnel\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/ba7e22bc52.jpg)\n\nLyman Blvd Tunnel\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/0417abfbcc.jpg)\n\nBluff Creek Road Tunnel\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/06cf92e00a.jpg)\n\nThen I actually found the end of the trail so I turned around and ran back to my car üòÅ. I had actually never run on this trail before so even though the map said it was going to end sometimes things aren‚Äôt updated that well and I was thinking it might have gone further. So it did surprise me when I came to the end and the path did not go further or connect up to anything else. I am guessing it is because if they wanted to keep extending it South they would have to figure out how to go over or under HWY-212. \n\nOverall, it was really nice trail that was all asphalt so I might have to remember this one for next summer with the kids as the distance isn‚Äôt to crazy either.\n\n---- \n  \n_**Update**: Since I didn‚Äôt post this yesterday as planned, I dug into some of the old Chanhassen park records and it seems like the Master Park / Trail plans from 2017 and 2018 assumed they would continue it further South. I wonder if once the construction of HWY-212 was completed they just abandoned the original plan or maybe didn‚Äôt leave a passage to get under it. I did notice that the HWY was on the original plans but based on what I know it wouldn‚Äôt have been completed at that time and was still a work in progress. Additionally, the details of their plan never really addressed how it was going to get past that HWY like other referenced markings on the plan to show an existing bridge or tunnel._\n\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Back when I was a long time Fitbit user, I used to have a scale from them as well so all of my fitness information was in once place. In fact, from time to time I would keep track of foods I ate in the Fitbit app as well and it worked pretty well overall.</p>\n<p>However, as time has passed I got <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/10/08/goodbye-fitbit.html\">frustrated with Fitbit</a> and it‚Äôs lack of durability from my point of view and move to a Garmin. I still used my Fitbit scale until it broke not long after but also my wife had bought one of those <a href=\"myshapa.com\">Shapa scales</a> that was about the worst type of scale out there. Sorry, I am sure it works for some people but for me I could care less what color I had I just wanted to know my actual weight in lbs üòÜ. I did figure out how I could get a number by having the information shared with Google Fit and then I could just manually put it into my Garmin Connect app. I hate to say I did that for longer than I would like to have admitted before I got tired of doing the manual part and just donated the scale as no one else was using the piece of garbage anyways.</p>\n<p>That brings me to today as I would like to keep track of my weight again as well as try to track my calorie intake. I am trying to figure out the best route to take here and am open to suggestions. Ideally, I would like a single app that could pull all of this information together as a one stop shop. I know I could buy a normal scale and enter the information manually but for me I want to set a routine of standing on the scale and not make notes to myself to record it in a system.

				"content_text": "Back when I was a long time Fitbit user, I used to have a scale from them as well so all of my fitness information was in once place. In fact, from time to time I would keep track of foods I ate in the Fitbit app as well and it worked pretty well overall.\n\nHowever, as time has passed I got [frustrated with Fitbit](https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/10/08/goodbye-fitbit.html) and it‚Äôs lack of durability from my point of view and move to a Garmin. I still used my Fitbit scale until it broke not long after but also my wife had bought one of those [Shapa scales](myshapa.com) that was about the worst type of scale out there. Sorry, I am sure it works for some people but for me I could care less what color I had I just wanted to know my actual weight in lbs üòÜ. I did figure out how I could get a number by having the information shared with Google Fit and then I could just manually put it into my Garmin Connect app. I hate to say I did that for longer than I would like to have admitted before I got tired of doing the manual part and just donated the scale as no one else was using the piece of garbage anyways.\n\nThat brings me to today as I would like to keep track of my weight again as well as try to track my calorie intake. I am trying to figure out the best route to take here and am open to suggestions. Ideally, I would like a single app that could pull all of this information together as a one stop shop. I know I could buy a normal scale and enter the information manually but for me I want to set a routine of standing on the scale and not make notes to myself to record it in a system. I just want it to be automatic! Kind of like the Fitbit did for me before but since I don‚Äôt have a Fitbit watch that seems kind of silly for that and I have found nothing plays super nice with Garmin Connect. Ideally, it would be something that can send data to or pull information from Garmin Connect or Apple Health.\n\n_Any suggestions send them my way please!_\n\n",

There are always obstacles in the way, better things to do, or thinking we are too busy to do something. As a &ldquo;runner&rdquo; myself, I can personally relate to the specific stories of running as no matter how much I love running, being outdoors, It is much better to have the run done and behind me as I too am someone that struggles most of the time to just get out the door.

				"title": "Treadmill vs Exercise Bike",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I have always liked the idea of an exercise bike. In fact, last December when my wife was talking about buying one over a treadmill I told her to go for it. I assumed since I run so much outside in all kinds of weather why would I choose to run inside and not really moving? I mean, I like to explore the outdoors in all seasons. Snow, Ice, Ran, wicked winds all of those don't deter me if I am planning on running or want to run. Even in smog-filled cities or cities, I don't even know where I am going I prefer to run outside than on the treadmill. So easy enough a bike for indoors makes sense then... Or does it...</p>\n<p>Over the past year, I have used the exercise bike 4 times, yep only 4, and one of them was in the first couple of days trying it out and the most recent time was today üòÅ. Don't get me wrong it isn't like the bike is buried away somewhere in the house so it is out of sight out of mind. In fact quite the opposite, since I have been working from home since March, it is in the same room as me so I can't really say I forgot about it üòÅ.</p>\n<p>After some reflection and conversation with friends, I realized I would have been better off with a treadmill. It wouldn't have taken the place of my running, well maybe once or twice but ultimately I could have been walking on it while on phone calls or watching TV. The times when I can't leave the house for a run but could move at a moderate clip to get some exercise in.</p>\n<p>\n  Now you might be thinking you could do the same with an exercise bike Eric! And yes, that is true but the difference is the key...\n  <br />\n</p>\n<p>\n  <b><i>You have to keep moving or you will fall on the treadmill vs exercise bike you can slow to a stop and not give the same movement or output.</i></b>\n</p>\n<p>That right there is my answer. On a treadmill, you have to just let your subconscious take over to keep your legs moving at the pace you set. If not well it might not end well...</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/3cff2b39c7.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n<p>On the bike, however, I have to monitor the pace and use brainpower to have my legs move at the speed I want because the bike will not keep moving and pushing me forward. That right there gives me too much room to fail.</p>\n<p>It isn't that I am not determined in my workouts or exercise routines. It is just I am smart about it, I know my body and sometimes I need to trick it or force its hand. A couple of weeks back I was thinking I should run further but wasn't sure I really wanted to. So what did I do? I ran more or less a loop that requires me to run the whole thing in order to get back. No short cuts or stopping early. The distance was going to be the distance so I might as well run it.</p>\n<p>So for me, Treadmills &gt; Exercise Bikes when it comes to a mindless activity to get your body moving.</p>\n",

If you are looking for a great book then look no further as Eliot has produced another great page-turner after not long ago finishing his most recent sequels.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>\n<em>The book was released on May 20th, 2020, but I was lucky enough to get an advanced copy from my good friend Eliot himself. However, I enjoyed the book so much that once it was released I purchased another copy as well for my collection.</em><br>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nUnlike some of Eliot‚Äôs other books, I actually felt like this one started a little slower but that was a good thing. As with a lot of good books, it built you up getting to know the characters and backgrounds. Speaking of, the main character, Zia Le√≥n seems like your normal humanitarian that leads various aid missions to help areas in need. However, what makes Zia unique is she comes with sass and attitude that fits her well in order to get the job done.</p>\n<p>As the first part of the story goes I was trying at times to see how all the pieces were going to fit together. Honestly, it took me a little while to start putting the pieces together, and then all of a sudden a kidnapping happened and I could not put this book down. Not only does the story speed up but more is revealed along the way that made it even more of a page-turner. I soon found out that the adventure was just beginning for Zia.</p>\n<p>Eliot does it again by looking into the near future and laying out what might happened due to various social/global issues that are relevant in today‚Äôs world.

				"content_text": "<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Veil-Eliot-Peper-ebook/dp/B085PSTJNC/?tag=stthink-20\">Veil</a> by Eliot Peper (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/eliotpeper\">@EliotPeper</a>) was just released a week ago and I really can‚Äôt say enough good things about it. If you are looking for a great book then look no further as Eliot has produced another great page-turner after not long ago finishing his most recent sequels.  \n\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Veil-Eliot-Peper-ebook/dp/B085PSTJNC/?tag=stthink-20\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/11f75ef022.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-51123504\" title=\"\"/></a>  \n_The book was released on May 20th, 2020, but I was lucky enough to get an advanced copy from my good friend Eliot himself. However, I enjoyed the book so much that once it was released I purchased another copy as well for my collection._  \n<br>\nUnlike some of Eliot‚Äôs other books, I actually felt like this one started a little slower but that was a good thing. As with a lot of good books, it built you up getting to know the characters and backgrounds. Speaking of, the main character, Zia Le√≥n seems like your normal humanitarian that leads various aid missions to help areas in need. However, what makes Zia unique is she comes with sass and attitude that fits her well in order to get the job done.  \n\nAs the first part of the story goes I was trying at times to see how all the pieces were going to fit together. Honestly, it took me a little while to start putting the pieces together, and then all of a sudden a kidnapping happened and I could not put this book down. Not only does the story speed up but more is revealed along the way that made it even more of a page-turner. I soon found out that the adventure was just beginning for Zia.  \n\nEliot does it again by looking into the near future and laying out what might happened due to various social/global issues that are relevant in today‚Äôs world. With his ability to research those relevant topics, expand on them to plausible future events and outcomes all while crafting other drama into the story always amazes me. Don‚Äôt get me wrong there is more to the story than just social events as friendships are tested, betrayal unfolds, and stubborn relationships rear their ugly heads. Everything centers around Zia and she must deal with them all along the way.  \n\n### Final Thoughts  \nThe one thing I appreciate about Eliot‚Äôs books is the way he sometimes weaves things from other books into the mix. I might have only caught one referring to an open-sourced software architecture üòÉ but I am sure there were more. Additionally, he finds ways to weave current locations and eating establishments that again makes the futuristic feel of this book that much closer to home.  \n\nI have really been enjoying Eliot‚Äôs near future books as the concepts and issues are not unrealistic to see come to fruition. Not to mention he always seems to be writing about topics that are big and bold and not just ones that change over the course of a year.  \n\nThis is again one of those books I really can't recommend enough.

Not all of my work trips had such a spectacular sight to see, however, I made the most of almost wherever I went mostly because my early morning or late afternoon runs would lead me to some interesting overlook or park.\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/51700aafea.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-51123118\"/>  \n*Looking towards Tower 23 in the far distance at the Mutianyu Great Wall before the steep climb to come with no one in sight. (May 2019, Mutianyu Great Wall, Beijing China)*\n<br>\nSpeaking of running, over the past year I continued on with my running and eventually hit a goal that formulated in my mind as the year went on. In October I had hit a mark of running a <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/09/30/k-a-day.html\">5K a day for 365 days</a>. The timing of that seemed to be about perfect as I am looking back at the last 5 months since I don't think I could have kept it up. However, my running goals have been focused more on distance now and not the consistency of every day running. Some other benefits of my odd running achievement were that I embraced the unknown and talked about my running adventure on a podcast called <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2020/02/18/off-the-couch.html\">Off the Couch</a>. It was something new to me and when they reached out I figured why not.\n<br>\nWith everything that is going on in the world right now and the focus on physically distancing us and the bans on travel in place as well. I think continuing with the theme of <b>Embracing</b> seems fitting. We are in a very interesting time where my wife and I are both working from home and we have all of the kids with us every day for what might be the end of this school year. In addition, with no after school activities or playdates with friends, this is a great time to be together as a family and do things you always feel you never have time for. My wife and I were just commenting the other day how many weekends or nights do we really have nothing going on. So we are going to embrace this time together as a family and hope we all don't want to kill each other in the end üòÑ.  \n\n<br>\n\nPreviously: <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/03/24/thirtyfive.html\">35</a>, <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2017/03/24/thirtysix.html\">36</a>, <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2018/03/24/thirtyseven.html\">37</a>, <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/03/24/thirtyeight.html\">38</a> ..\n",

You will quickly find out in short drifting is just following along the status quo or coasting through life accepting everything that is happening.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large\"><p><i>‚ÄúPeople do not decide their futures, they decide their habits and their habits decide their futures.‚Äù</i> </p><cite> <em>F.M. Alexander </em> </cite></blockquote>\n\n<p>As someone who has written about <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/02/19/power-of-the.html\">habits</a> before and not long ago had a very addicting habit that added up to <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/09/30/k-a-day.html\">a lot of miles being run</a>, I was very interested in seeing what the author had to say. Not too far into the book he hits you with some quick questions like <em>\"Are you feeling bored? Restless? Trapped?\"</em> and if your answers are yes then the solution is that <i><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">It's Time to Take Back Control of Your Life</span></i>.</p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell, that is what the book is really based on. The nice thing about this book, in my opinion, is that it is short and very consumable. However, not too short that he doesn't add some examples throughout each topic. However, It is really broken down into 4 parts which have simple enough concepts:</p>\n\n<h3>Awakening</h3>\n\n<p>Being aware as you cannot change what you are not aware of. Uncover the habits that are operating in your blind spots. Once your habits are brought out into light you can inspect them and disrupt them.</p>\n\n<h3>Disrupting</h3>\n\n<p>Disrupting is the process of interrupting your perpetual patterns and breaking the stimulus and response cycle. When you do this, you get immediate and profound feedback on why you do what you do, and how these habits may be serving or oppressing you.</p>\n\n<h3>Designing</h3>\n\n<p>The first two parts of the book are pretty straightforward as he talks about how to pretty much break down your current habits and thinking in order to get to the designing part. In the designing chapter he talks a lot about Ultimate authority and how to set compelling goals. This is where he talks about creating new habits that empower your future.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><i>Ultimate authority means taking responsibility for the fact that your life is the sum total of every decision you‚Äôve ever made from the day you were born up until this very moment. This means you get to take credit for the many successes you‚Äôve had. It also means the shit parts of your life are on you too.</i></p></blockquote>\n\n<h3>Sustaining</h3>\n\n<p>The part of the book I think makes the most sense. Obviously, if you have completed the above topics then you have to figure out a way to keep moving forward.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><i><b>The Awakening, Disrupting and Designing (ADD) Cycle we have just walked through in this book is a process that should be repeated and not a one-time exercise.</b></i></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>The above statement by the author was a great strategic point to make towards the end of the book for a reminder about sustaining. There are a lot of things we do in life thinking if we just do it once all is good. However, in reality, we need to continue to work on things no matter if it is trying to rid ourselves of excess possessions, weight, or anything else. Each day is a new day that you really have to tackle the problem again. The advantage you have as you build up the consecutive days is that it becomes a habit and less you might have to think about in the future.</p>\n\n<h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>\n\n<p>Overall, I enjoyed the book and if anything it made me think about various things I do and maybe things I have been thinking about changing or doing in my life but haven‚Äôt taken that next step. I really did enjoy that the book was a quick read as I could see myself flipping through the pages again at some point in time as it gives off a measure of motivation too.</p>\n\n<p>If you think the book would be interesting to you, it can be found on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077K9J6PT\">Amazon</a> or through the publisher‚Äôs website (<a href=\"https://www.tckpublishing.com/\">TCK Publishing</a>).</p>\n",

Michael Abrashoff is a really good book if you are ever contemplating a management position or are currently in a management position. The story does a great job laying out examples of how Captain Abrashoff took a poor performing ship in the navy to become one of the sought after ships people wanted to be assigned to.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":51123417,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"custom\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Its-Your-Ship-Management-Techniques-ebook/dp/B001HPW9R4/?tag=stthink-20\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/3afb243583.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-51123417\"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Even though most of the concepts are not new in this book nor do I think the author claimed that the methods he used were entirely his own. I do think how he accomplished them is very interesting and sheds some light on how he thought about things differently during his command. In fact, many of his stories are how he tried doing something one way only to talk through and come up with a better way. It goes to show you that he too was learning through the process from day one.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><b><em>Of course, trying something new is never easy. For one thing, there aren‚Äôt any precedents to guide you. And that can be a very good thing.</em></b></p><cite>Captain D. Michael Abrashoff</cite></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, as much as I enjoyed the book I feel how it was laid out did not necessarily flow as well as I would have liked as I feel he repeated himself from time to time. The reason for that is obvious as he was breaking down chapters into Management topics and not in the chronological order that events happened. It is just something to think about as sometimes I was trying to figure out in what order he started to do certain things or implementing new tactics.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Takeaways</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Different than some of my other book reviews I am going to just write out a couple of notes I took that may or may not be helpful to you. Now as I mentioned the book is very focused from a managers prespective. However, the notes I took could be turned inward as well. Depending on your line of business or work you do because in all honesty aren‚Äôt we kind of an employee even if it is for ourselves?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As I read the book the following themes stuck out to me that could be used in any situation depending on how you read it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Lead by Example</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This seems to go without saying. Can you actually do what you are asking others to do? Also, if you got different results than you were expecting to ask yourself his simple questions:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>Did I clearly articulate the goals?</li><li>Did I give people enough time and resources to accomplish the task?</li><li>Did I give them enough training?</li><li>Listen Aggressively</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Abrashoff got personal in his discussions with the crew while learning about their personal lives, why they joined the Navy and their thoughts on how to improve the ship. By taking the time to listen and not just give orders he discovered that he had a crew of smart, talented, and innovative men and women, but they weren‚Äôt being heard. This can be true in many interactions today, sometimes the best thing to do is listen to the other people instead of making sure your voice is heard. You might find something out that can be more beneficial to your purpose or goal.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Communicate with Purpose</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>No matter how fantastic your message is, if no one is receiving it, you aren‚Äôt communicating. It is up to you to clearly define the mission and vision of the organization and then to communicate clearly and concisely.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Take risks</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Everyone in an organization must feel comfortable taking calculated risks. The key is to know the parameters in which they can take those calculated risks and that everyone understands that you might not always win. Remember to not over encourage perfection as it will limit your ability to think creatively and take risks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Praise</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As a manager myself I found this one spot on with his quote.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><i><b>Show me a manager that ignores the power of praise and I will show you a lousy manager, praise is infinitely more powerful than punishment.</b></i></p><cite>Captain D. Michael Abrashoff</cite></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, as with most of these points above, the simple act of giving praise to someone even if you don‚Äôt have a working relationship as the book describes can go a long way. There are a lot of people putting stuff out there and the act of giving recognition might seem small for you but 100x the effect for the person receiving it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I would recommend this book as I found it an interesting read with a couple of good takeaways.  I don't think this book is for everyone as some of the takeaways can be found in other books. However, I enjoyed hearing the stories of how Captain Abrashoff achieved his success.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

I didn‚Äôt feel great running at first either so I knew just sticking to an easier route was a good plan so then I could get home and have some time before I rushed off to work. However, as I looked at my watch and realized I was at about 2 miles into my run and approaching my house I thought why not just continue and run another 3.1 mile loop that goes a different direction.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So that is just what I did and I continued on a different route.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote {\"className\":\"is-style-default\"} -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p><i><b>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not so much that I began to run, but that I continued‚Äù</b></i></p><cite>Hal Higdon</cite></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>You might be wondering why I shared the story above with you but stick with me and read on :)</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was glad to have extended my total run to the full 6.2 miles I had planned to run the night before.

However, by being so focused on the current path we could be losing sight of what we really want as an end goal. In fact, we could miss a turn that might take us off the current route but still headed in the right direction overall.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This has happened to me quite a few times most specifically in careers or jobs. I know what I would like to be doing down the road from now or how that might look. However, sometimes I get so stuck in a role (path) thinking it will eventually get me there as I had originally planned. Then another year goes by and I realize I am no closer to where I would like to end up and in reality, I might be further behind or off track. If only I would have stopped ignoring other interesting routes that would probably lead me to the same destination as my goal.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ultimately, I am beginning to learn that taking small steps and keeping the course is a good thing in life as long as you continue to move forward. However, you should make sure you are aware of your surroundings and make sure you aren‚Äôt just following a path because that was your original plan. You also need to make sure you are keeping your head up and making sure you aren‚Äôt so focused on the trail in front of you that you might be passing up other opportunities.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

It was good to get outside as well as catch up with her.  \n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/7d1c727804.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-51123361\"/>  \n*Had a great time enjoying the beautiful weather running around Lake Harriet and catching up with my cousin yesterday (November 2019, Lake Harriet, Minneapolis, MN)*  \n\nFinally, I took my wife out on a couple of lunch dates where we could take our time eating and just enjoy each other's company with nothing big to rush to the next event or worry we are paying some babysitter to allow our kids to watch TV at home :).  \n\nI am sad that my time away from work is over as I am now three weeks into my new job. However, I am going to think of ways going forward that I can take a week off and just be at home as disconnected as I can. Another thought is to just take some random days off here and there where I can just do my own thing without other priorities or reasons for taking the day off. I believe that would allow me to be refocused and refreshed going back to work the next day.  \n\n<i><b>Have any of you ever just completely disconnected from work? If so what did you think of it and was it helpful?</b></i>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I have used my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fitbit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> since January 2014 after what I remember was a long time trying to decide if I really wanted one and if so which one. Thinking back it has served its purpose well and I will give it some credit for keeping me active over the past years.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Over the course of the timeline above, I used a handful of watches. Most I bought because I wanted GPS capabilities however I did own two that were only step counters. From the data above you are probably wondering why there is a big gap in 2014. Long story short after I decided on getting a Fitbit at the end of 2013, I went for the new Fitbit force since it could actually show the time as I thought it was silly to just have a tracker band on my wrist. Unfortunately for me, I had issues with that watch and had to return it. At that time they didn‚Äôt have a replacement as all of them were recalled so they just returned my money in Full.</p>\n<h2 id=\"positives\">Positives</h2>\n<h3 id=\"community\">Community</h3>\n<p>Due to the fact Fitbit was kind of a pioneer in the step tracking market, a lot of people jumped on board quickly. I don‚Äôt recall when they started their community to connect with people and have challenges but it has been for as long as I can remember. This is something they did well early on too as it encouraged people to do more in order to try to keep up with family or friends. I enjoyed looking at where people&rsquo;s 7-day averages were and how well I did against them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"customer-support\">Customer Support</h3>\n<p>Hands down the one thing Fitbit has done (at least from my perspective) from day one is having great customer support. Put aside the question of quality as remember early on this was a new type of technology. I have purchased 5 different <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fitbit<!-- raw HTML omitted --> devices for myself during the 5 year period.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fitbit Force (Step tracker with Time Display) - Recalled</li>\n<li>Fitbit Flex (Step Tracker ONLY) - Free replacement after it got water in it</li>\n<li>Fitbit Surge (GPS Watch) - Free replacement after the band broke as this version doesn&rsquo;t have removable watch bands</li>\n<li>Fitbit Ionic (GPS Watch) - Free replacement after it just died and didn&rsquo;t turn back on</li>\n<li>Fitbit Aria (Scale) - Still the original / never got a replacement</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, I have had 8 devices. The first one was a factory recall and I got my full purchase price back. For the other 3, I purchased I had issues after a year or more and they replaced the device free of charge. When you spend more than $150 on newer technology and you are frugal it is a relief knowing that they stand behind the product.</p>\n<h2 id=\"main-issues\">Main Issues</h2>\n<h3 id=\"reporting-data\">Reporting Data</h3>\n<p>This was never really an issue years ago but as my use of my Fitbit watch changed it became more apparent. After having my year of running <!-- raw HTML omitted -->5K a day<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and wanting to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->look through the data<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and look back at things, I quickly realized that looking back at specific data in your Fitbit is near impossible. How can I find all of the ‚ÄúRuns‚Äù I completed in the previous year.</p>\n<p>You can click on the activities tab but everything is an activity and there is no good way to sort by type of activity. In addition, I can‚Äôt even easily export the information to do anything else with it. The good thing is most of my runs are in Strava which makes it super simple to export and look back at specific types of Activities (e.g., Runs vs Bike Rides).</p>\n<h3 id=\"unreliable-gps--watch\">Unreliable GPS / Watch</h3>\n<p>This kind of goes with my gripe above with data, however, a GPS watch itself is only as good as when it is tracking. If I didn‚Äôt want to know where and how far I ran, then I would not have paid over $250 for my Fitbit Ionic and just bought a $30 Timex like I used to wear in High School.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><em>No chance of this watch failing unless the battery ran out.</em></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><em>The Fitbit Surge was a good watch and my first GPS watch.</em></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><em>I really did like the Fitbit Ionic as it had a big clear display.</em></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><em>One of the times my Fitbit failed in the past year around 1 mile into my run. I thought that since you could swim with this watch on it would have been able to survive the rain I was running through.</em></p>\n<p>However, since I did spend that money on a GPS watch that is what I want. Below are some great examples of when my Fitbit would just fail me in the middle of the run. I realized that the map makes it look like I stopped and just didn‚Äôt complete the loop back to my house. Just for reference though, I do not stop a half-mile from my house as I always make it all the way back to my starting point no matter how much further that makes me run.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h2 id=\"will-i-miss-anything\">Will I miss anything?</h2>\n<p>I will miss the Community and the data I already have out there. I have tried to pull over as much data as I can into my new system but not all data is created equal even when importing. As I noted before since all of my runs were in Strava that was easier to get and import all of those into a new system.</p>\n<p>As for the community, I will miss that as well since two of my kids have Fitbits and it was always fun being able to quickly see how I ranked over them. Even with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3.1 mile runs every day<!-- raw HTML omitted --> my kids still beat me in steps, unless they didn‚Äôt wear their watch. However, as for other family and friends, they too have started to drift away from Fitbit.</p>\n<p>My guess is most people got Apple watches and didn‚Äôt want to wear both. Or if they wanted more of a Runners / Workout watch they went to Garmin or Suunto. I have been connecting with runners on Strava and it seems most drift to Garmin.</p>\n<h2 id=\"question-for-you\">Question for you?</h2>\n<p>Do you track your steps or fitness activities using a watch?

Long story short after I decided on getting a Fitbit at the end of 2013, I went for the new Fitbit force since it could actually show the time as I thought it was silly to just have a tracker band on my wrist. Unfortunately for me, I had issues with that watch and had to return it. At that time they didn‚Äôt have a replacement as all of them were recalled so they just returned my money in Full.  \n\n## Positives  \n\n### Community\nDue to the fact Fitbit was kind of a pioneer in the step tracking market, a lot of people jumped on board quickly. I don‚Äôt recall when they started their community to connect with people and have challenges but it has been for as long as I can remember. This is something they did well early on too as it encouraged people to do more in order to try to keep up with family or friends. I enjoyed looking at where people's 7-day averages were and how well I did against them.\n\n### Customer Support  \nHands down the one thing Fitbit has done (at least from my perspective) from day one is having great customer support. Put aside the question of quality as remember early on this was a new type of technology. I have purchased 5 different <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Fitbit_products\">Fitbit</a> devices for myself during the 5 year period.\n\n* Fitbit Force (Step tracker with Time Display) - Recalled\n* Fitbit Flex (Step Tracker ONLY) - Free replacement after it got water in it\n* Fitbit Surge (GPS Watch) - Free replacement after the band broke as this version doesn't have removable watch bands\n* Fitbit Ionic (GPS Watch) - Free replacement after it just died and didn't turn back on\n* Fitbit Aria (Scale) - Still the original / never got a replacement  \n\n\nHowever, I have had 8 devices. The first one was a factory recall and I got my full purchase price back. For the other 3, I purchased I had issues after a year or more and they replaced the device free of charge. When you spend more than $150 on newer technology and you are frugal it is a relief knowing that they stand behind the product.  \n\n## Main Issues  \n\n### Reporting Data  \nThis was never really an issue years ago but as my use of my Fitbit watch changed it became more apparent. After having my year of running <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/09/k-a-day.html\">5K a day</a> and wanting to <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/10/03/k-a-day.html\">look through the data</a> and look back at things, I quickly realized that looking back at specific data in your Fitbit is near impossible. How can I find all of the ‚ÄúRuns‚Äù I completed in the previous year.  \n\nYou can click on the activities tab but everything is an activity and there is no good way to sort by type of activity. In addition, I can‚Äôt even easily export the information to do anything else with it. The good thing is most of my runs are in Strava which makes it super simple to export and look back at specific types of Activities (e.g., Runs vs Bike Rides).  \n\n### Unreliable GPS / Watch  \nThis kind of goes with my gripe above with data, however, a GPS watch itself is only as good as when it is tracking. If I didn‚Äôt want to know where and how far I ran, then I would not have paid over $250 for my Fitbit Ionic and just bought a $30 Timex like I used to wear in High School.  \n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/37d0dcb693.jpg\" width=\"350\" alt=\"Timex Ironman Watch\" data-id=\"51123273\" />\n\n*No chance of this watch failing unless the battery ran out.*  \n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/e46fe50e47.jpg\"  width=\"350\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"51123278\" />  \n\n*The Fitbit Surge was a good watch and my first GPS watch.*  \n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/7e951ca156.jpg\"  width=\"350\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"51123274\" />\n\n*I really did like the Fitbit Ionic as it had a big clear display.*  \n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/1b6b9e75a3.jpg\" width=\"350\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"51123275\" />  \n\n*One of the times my Fitbit failed in the past year around 1 mile into my run. I thought that since you could swim with this watch on it would have been able to survive the rain I was running through.*  \n\nHowever, since I did spend that money on a GPS watch that is what I want. Below are some great examples of when my Fitbit would just fail me in the middle of the run. I realized that the map makes it look like I stopped and just didn‚Äôt complete the loop back to my house. Just for reference though, I do not stop a half-mile from my house as I always make it all the way back to my starting point no matter how much further that makes me run.  \n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/577c3c3f6e.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"51123268\" />  \n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/cac02f51c1.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"51123269\" />  \n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/24d9581a52.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"51123267\" />  \n*Really! Come on Fitbit why did you have to die after 1.5 miles.*  \n<br>\nAs I look at the GPS fails above, it is kind of interesting that each one seems to die after a little over 1.5 miles. Not sure if that is a coincidence or not.  \n\n## Will I miss anything?\nI will miss the Community and the data I already have out there. I have tried to pull over as much data as I can into my new system but not all data is created equal even when importing. As I noted before since all of my runs were in Strava that was easier to get and import all of those into a new system.  \n\nAs for the community, I will miss that as well since two of my kids have Fitbits and it was always fun being able to quickly see how I ranked over them. Even with <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/09/k-a-day/\">3.1 mile runs every day</a> my kids still beat me in steps, unless they didn‚Äôt wear their watch. However, as for other family and friends, they too have started to drift away from Fitbit.  \n\nMy guess is most people got Apple watches and didn‚Äôt want to wear both. Or if they wanted more of a Runners / Workout watch they went to Garmin or Suunto. I have been connecting with runners on Strava and it seems most drift to Garmin.  \n\n## Question for you?  \nDo you track your steps or fitness activities using a watch? If so what kind do you have? If you have had a Fitbit ever what kind did you have and what are your thoughts on it?\n",

However, all of the data in the charts came from <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/\">Strava</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fitbit.com/\">Fitbit</a>.</p>\n<p>So without further ado, here are some fun charts to look at from the past year where I completed 1189.45 miles with a little color commentary.</p>\n<h2 id=\"when-did-you-run\">When did you run?</h2>\n<p>This is one of the first questions I got after my previous post, When did I do most of my running? I have been asked this question by friends and family members before and without looking at the chart my answer was always the morning without a doubt. With 3 kids in activities, the morning was the one time I could really control what I did. If I didn‚Äôt do it first thing there was always a chance that plans could change and I would be doing it at midnight. However, it did get me thinking about how often I ran the rest of the day over the past 12 months.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/35173af475.jpg\" alt=\"\"><br>\nAs you can see morning took it by a landslide. Now that it is Fall again and almost time for Winter I was reminded that running in the dark is not my favorite as I have been spoiled for the last 3-4 months of the morning running with the sunrise. This morning I just cranked out 6 miles and it was all in darkness.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/f79835fb4b.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n<em>Always a win when I would find a new route that actually has some street lights (Septemeber 2018, Eden Prairie, MN)</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/3c38defd81.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n<em>Completed my annual self made &ldquo;Turkey Trot&rdquo; in the early morning hours while watching the sunrise (November 2018, Nevada, IA)</em></p>\n<p>Now being the data nerd I am I was thinking the next best slice would be to see a number of runs/miles by the day of the week. I was interested to see that I ran fewer miles on the weekend than I did during the week.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/87a9e1be53.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Now here is where I am going to kind of skate over data quality because it might be more valuable in another post as I will probably rant quite a bit on that topic. However, I have some double runs during the middle of some weeks due to international flights. In addition, not to play down my commitment to running because there were a couple of times in the past year I ran twice a day by CHOICE! You read that right I chose to run not only in the morning but at night as well. Don‚Äôt worry I didn‚Äôt make a habit out of it and it only happened because as I said previously I sometimes had to plan a week out in advance. Obviously, since I mostly wanted to get my runs done early as a way to not forget, someone would message me mid-day seeing if I wanted to run that evening. I mean how could I say no?</p>\n<h2 id=\"friday-mornings-take-the-real-win\">Friday Mornings take the real WIN!</h2>\n<p>After looking at that last set of data I pondered if there was anything else I would like to see. That is when it hit me that it would be interesting to see based on the day of the week when did I typically run.</p>\n<p>I was not really sure what to expect on this chart before pulling it together. The only thing I could think of was besides mornings probably being pretty spread out during a given week. I would have thought more evening runs as I would try to squeeze them in right after work or while at a kid&rsquo;s activity. As you can see from the data below, that is not entirely what is being shown.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/fdefdfdb5f.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>After looking over the chart below I came to two realizations:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I also did a similar slice based on miles but as you can see it didn‚Äôt really tell me anything as the chart looks about the same since I was always hovering around 3.1 miles with very rare exceptions though most of and then at the end.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/ef806307e5.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"pace\">Pace</h2>\n<p>Finally, after I was pulling all this data together I was wondering what was my average pace over the course of these 12 months. The overall answer is 7:47 min miles. I decided to create some quick average charts by day and month. The day chart kind of puzzled me except when thinking about the other data above. I most likely got better rest before my Saturday run as I didn‚Äôt always have to do it at dawn.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/3800be7ba7.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>When you look at the monthly chart this is even more interesting but I have a few ideas of why it might look like it does.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/69003594bd.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>From when I started till about January I was on a steady decline. However, those runs were mostly solo in nature and a more consistent route due to darkness, and early snowfall. Don‚Äôt forget it got cold in January and I might have tried to run faster outside just to get the run done in the early morning.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/a50e43f3bf.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n<em>Running with my daughter and the dog. Not a bad way to start the day as it is always filled with conversations. Not to mention more stops by both to see and listen to nature (March 2019, Eden Prairie, MN)</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/00f8213f34.jpg\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<em>Frozen face run in -9.4¬∞F (February 2019, Eden Prairie MN)</em></p>\n<p>The Spring months I was running more with Lainey Lou the Doodle (our dog) which then slowed down my pace. In addition, I would run sometimes with my daughter who would like to bike along with me and sometimes she just wanted to stop. Finally, in the late April / May timeframe it was starting to get nicer out that I could do more trails around the area. In May especially, I was traveling and was running in the hills of Arizona, streets of China and a number of Treadmill runs due to the arrival of flights. I know that Treadmill run data was about the worst because I only have my watch data to go on and most of the time it never said I ran as far as the treadmill said I did.</p>\n<p>So after all of my analysis above, I got to thinking I might be missing some data here that might be in addition to the chart above. The one above only gave average pace but I was more curious about what the min and max were as well. I think this chart helps answer some of those questions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/7ee112f17d.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Looking at the chart above I think it further supports my hypothesis of running in different places and on the treadmill.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fastest-times\">Fastest Times</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I figured since I was sharing all of this data anyways I should probably share some Personal Bests during my year of running. I was thinking of doing a chart like some of the above but I realized I didn&rsquo;t really have good data around this. Mostly because I didn&rsquo;t always stop running right at 3.1 miles, so it would be hard with the data I have to give more meaning than overall bests.</p>\n<p>Luckily, Strava has some overall personal bests that I could easily get and all of them except for the 10k came from a race I did in the summer. In looking at the data now, I wish I would have broken the 20 min mark but I can&rsquo;t really complain as I was never shooting for a specific time. Also, I did well as I was in the top 15 overall and  2nd in my age group.</p>\n<p>I actually did 2 races over the past year and surprised myself during both of them with good enough times considering I was running every day with no breaks. Running a 5k a day made me realize that running those 5K races were really nothing. I did them every day so it wasn&rsquo;t a big deal, I knew I would finish it so then it was just a matter of at what point in the race should I pick up my pace or pass someone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I never really set out to put any data together when I originally started running. In fact, I didn‚Äôt really think about it when I realized that I was actually going to be running for a year. To both of those facts, I might have been a little short-sided, as looking back I would have done things differently in order to make sure I had the data easily available. I would not have used it to change what happened on a day to day basis as my goal was never to run faster or even longer. I did use my Strava data and my Fitbit data to just look back at a given week or compare runs every now and then to see if there was any small progress. However, my ultimate goal was the consistency of doing it every day.</p>\n",

I was interested to see that I ran fewer miles on the weekend than I did during the week.  \n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/87a9e1be53.jpg)\n\nNow here is where I am going to kind of skate over data quality because it might be more valuable in another post as I will probably rant quite a bit on that topic. However, I have some double runs during the middle of some weeks due to international flights. In addition, not to play down my commitment to running because there were a couple of times in the past year I ran twice a day by CHOICE! You read that right I chose to run not only in the morning but at night as well. Don‚Äôt worry I didn‚Äôt make a habit out of it and it only happened because as I said previously I sometimes had to plan a week out in advance. Obviously, since I mostly wanted to get my runs done early as a way to not forget, someone would message me mid-day seeing if I wanted to run that evening. I mean how could I say no?  \n\n## Friday Mornings take the real WIN!  \nAfter looking at that last set of data I pondered if there was anything else I would like to see. That is when it hit me that it would be interesting to see based on the day of the week when did I typically run.  \n\nI was not really sure what to expect on this chart before pulling it together. The only thing I could think of was besides mornings probably being pretty spread out during a given week. I would have thought more evening runs as I would try to squeeze them in right after work or while at a kid's activity. As you can see from the data below, that is not entirely what is being shown.  \n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/fdefdfdb5f.jpg) \n\nAfter looking over the chart below I came to two realizations:\n<ol><li>I am not sure how Strava categorizes Morning, Lunch, Afternoon, Evening or Night run. The biggest problem I see here is that there is a big gap between what I would consider Morning and Lunch. Then in the afternoon and evening, I am not sure what that fine line is to trip it from Lunch to Afternoon to evening. I spot checked a couple of specific days and it was counting afternoon as 5:50 PM. Not sure if that is where it should fall but then the data started to make more sense as in the winter months for sure I ran more in the early evening (or still Afternoon) while my son played basketball.</li><li>I made a concerted effort to never run at night on Friday and in fact, it was the heaviest day of morning runs. I had never really thought of it but accept what the data says. Most of my Friday nights kids don‚Äôt have activities so with that in mind we are either doing something as a family at home or traveling somewhere for the weekend. Not to mention if you want to have a drink with the neighbor while grilling after work on a Friday it is best to get you run in early.</li></ol>\n\nI also did a similar slice based on miles but as you can see it didn‚Äôt really tell me anything as the chart looks about the same since I was always hovering around 3.1 miles with very rare exceptions though most of and then at the end.  \n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/ef806307e5.jpg) \n\n## Pace\nFinally, after I was pulling all this data together I was wondering what was my average pace over the course of these 12 months. The overall answer is 7:47 min miles. I decided to create some quick average charts by day and month. The day chart kind of puzzled me except when thinking about the other data above. I most likely got better rest before my Saturday run as I didn‚Äôt always have to do it at dawn.  \n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/3800be7ba7.jpg)\n\nWhen you look at the monthly chart this is even more interesting but I have a few ideas of why it might look like it does.  \n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/69003594bd.jpg)\n\nFrom when I started till about January I was on a steady decline. However, those runs were mostly solo in nature and a more consistent route due to darkness, and early snowfall. Don‚Äôt forget it got cold in January and I might have tried to run faster outside just to get the run done in the early morning.  \n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/a50e43f3bf.jpg)\n*Running with my daughter and the dog. Not a bad way to start the day as it is always filled with conversations. Not to mention more stops by both to see and listen to nature (March 2019, Eden Prairie, MN)*  \n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/00f8213f34.jpg)  \n*Frozen face run in -9.4¬∞F (February 2019, Eden Prairie MN)* \n\nThe Spring months I was running more with Lainey Lou the Doodle (our dog) which then slowed down my pace. In addition, I would run sometimes with my daughter who would like to bike along with me and sometimes she just wanted to stop. Finally, in the late April / May timeframe it was starting to get nicer out that I could do more trails around the area. In May especially, I was traveling and was running in the hills of Arizona, streets of China and a number of Treadmill runs due to the arrival of flights. I know that Treadmill run data was about the worst because I only have my watch data to go on and most of the time it never said I ran as far as the treadmill said I did.  \n\nSo after all of my analysis above, I got to thinking I might be missing some data here that might be in addition to the chart above. The one above only gave average pace but I was more curious about what the min and max were as well. I think this chart helps answer some of those questions.  \n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/7ee112f17d.jpg) \n\nLooking at the chart above I think it further supports my hypothesis of running in different places and on the treadmill.  \n\n## Fastest Times  \n\n<table class=\"wp-block-table alignright is-style-stripes\"><tbody><tr><th>Best Efforts</th></tr><tr><td>1k</td><td><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/2586825202#5474197455\">4:05</a></td></tr><tr><td>1 mile</td><td><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/2586825202#5474197456\">6:36</a></td></tr><tr><td>5k</td><td><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/2586825202#5474197458\">20:58</a></td></tr><tr><td>10k</td><td><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/2754168500#5824679526\">46:39</a></td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<br>\n\nI figured since I was sharing all of this data anyways I should probably share some Personal Bests during my year of running. I was thinking of doing a chart like some of the above but I realized I didn't really have good data around this. Mostly because I didn't always stop running right at 3.1 miles, so it would be hard with the data I have to give more meaning than overall bests.  \n\nLuckily, Strava has some overall personal bests that I could easily get and all of them except for the 10k came from a race I did in the summer. In looking at the data now, I wish I would have broken the 20 min mark but I can't really complain as I was never shooting for a specific time. Also, I did well as I was in the top 15 overall and  2nd in my age group.  \n\nI actually did 2 races over the past year and surprised myself during both of them with good enough times considering I was running every day with no breaks. Running a 5k a day made me realize that running those 5K races were really nothing. I did them every day so it wasn't a big deal, I knew I would finish it so then it was just a matter of at what point in the race should I pick up my pace or pass someone.  \n\n## Conclusion  \nI never really set out to put any data together when I originally started running. In fact, I didn‚Äôt really think about it when I realized that I was actually going to be running for a year. To both of those facts, I might have been a little short-sided, as looking back I would have done things differently in order to make sure I had the data easily available. I would not have used it to change what happened on a day to day basis as my goal was never to run faster or even longer. I did use my Strava data and my Fitbit data to just look back at a given week or compare runs every now and then to see if there was any small progress. However, my ultimate goal was the consistency of doing it every day.\n",

That day we went for 4 miles on a Saturday morning and it was great. Not to mention I felt really good. For the next week, I decided to keep with my 2-3 times a week but stretched myself to hit 3+ miles of which one was 6 miles. I kept that up for a couple of weeks when I then decided I wanted more. I wasn‚Äôt sure I had more time to run more miles in a given day, so the next best thing was to try to run a 5K (3.1 miles) every single day for a week. It didn‚Äôt seem as hard as I thought it was going to be keeping that up for a week so then I thought I would go for 2 weeks, then a full month. After, the month I figured I should do it for 3 months as that put me in January and I figured it would be too cold then. However, once January came along it was so ingrained into my daily habit that a 5K a day was just the normal. It became so normal in fact that I would just start planning my day around it. It was almost a non-negotiable item, no matter if I had to wake up at 5:00 AM to get an early morning run in or if I was doing it at 10:30 PM at night, I was going to get a run in.  \n\n## Planning is Key\nHonestly, this is the biggest takeaway I learned over the past year was planning.

I always knew who Scott Jurek was but I for some reason I didn't really realize he had run the Appalachian Trail and/or wrote a book about it. So as a runner myself I figured this would be the perfect book to listen to. The book chronicles Scott‚Äôs 2015 attempt at the Application Trail FKT (fastest known time) that he made with the assistance of his wife Jenny. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>Overall, I would suggest ‚ÄúNorth‚Äù to anyone that enjoys running or hiking.</em></strong> Not to say if you didn‚Äôt enjoy running or hiking you wouldn‚Äôt find this interesting but I do think you can relate to some points in the story. However, if you want to hear more of my take read on!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":51123180,\"align\":\"center\",\"linkDestination\":\"custom\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/North-Finding-While-Running-Appalachian-ebook/dp/B01N6Z44OZ/?tag=stthink-20\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/83a9c91640.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-51123180\"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The book is mainly from Scott‚Äôs point of view I did like the added benefit that Jenny‚Äôs views were intermixed in the book (as well as Audio) as well. It was interesting hearing what Jenny was thinking during the time as well as she could tell her husband Scott was hurting at times but also gave some insight into all that went on behind the scenes to assist while he was out running the trail. Also, the book is about so much more, you hear about their suffering, friendship, marriage, ego, and doubt.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>From the beginning of the story, you are dropped into the picture with Jenny and Scott discussing life and what is next. Scott seems to want something else out of life as he realizes he has been on autopilot. He wanted to capture the uncertainty and excitement that comes with putting yourself into an extreme challenge. Not to mention, he and his wife Jenny were also mentally and physically drained by her second miscarriage. For them, Scott‚Äôs attempt at the Application Trail FKT was a way for them to try to escape and reconnect with themselves. However, they were not entirely sure what they had gotten themselves into.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>46 DAYS - 2,189 MILES</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Everyone already knows the outcome of the book so that is not a spoiler to any degree. However, where the pages start to come together is listening to how they overcame the daily struggles on the trail. You can tell the injuries, deprivations, and setbacks all take a toll on the overall push for and ultimate broken record. It is in those daily struggles that words of motivation and inspiration flow to the reader.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":51123182,\"align\":\"center\",\"width\":768,\"height\":512} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/fd7463862e.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-51123182\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\"/><figcaption>The Appalachian Trail ¬©<a href=\"http://NPS - https://nps.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=6298c848ba2a490588b7f6d25453e4e0\">NPS</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":51123184,\"align\":\"right\",\"width\":304,\"height\":511} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright is-resized\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/4b86d608fe.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-51123184\" width=\"304\" height=\"511\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I listened to the Audiobook of this mostly while running of course :). I will say I really appreciate it when authors read their own books for Audiobooks, I think it adds something to it. Especially, if it is someone like Scott and Jenny that you have seen a picture of before and are a presence in the running community. It almost makes it feel like a friend just telling you a story.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I really find it easy to recommend this book as I think it is a great story to be told of his feat and you feel you are with both him and Jenny the whole way. Also, I found how the book was written can help motivate anyone to face a big obstacle.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Final note, if you are interested in more pictures and news from the actual event check out <a href=\"http://www.scottjurek.com/appalachian-trail\">Scott Jurek's website</a>.

In fact, I am currently writing this while flying back to the US and probably won't spend a lot of time editing it or polishing it up. Just some random observations.</i></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>People are always worried about how connected they are and how much they are doing things on their phones or devices in the US. My wife and I are included in this as we try to model good behavior of device usage at home and try not to be too dependent on it so we can be present for our kids. However, using my phone as a camera I knowingly pull it out of my pocket quite a bit so I can snap a picture of the kids or a beautiful landscape. I always feel I could do better here but after traveling for the past week I have started to realize our problem might not be as bad as we all think it is.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":51123065,\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/3b6ff5c1e4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-51123065\"/><figcaption>Photo credit <a href=\"https://travelsovertoys.com/\">Travels Over Toys</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have spent the last week in China where I was both in Shanghai and Beijing. Below are a couple of observations I have noticed about device usage.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Walking in the Streets</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While in China it didn‚Äôt stop me from running, even though my wife and mom thought I shouldn‚Äôt be out early in the morning running the streets of China. Not only from a safety perspective but air pollution as well. Don‚Äôt worry I am safely on a plane back to the US so all is well. On my first morning running, I noticed there was relatively no one out in the streets but it was bright enough outside to be 8 am back home. On that first day, 5 people almost walked right into me as they were deeply in thought of what was on their screen and facing down. Remember I was running and not being super stealthy trying to sneak up on anyone so they for sure had to have heard my feet hitting the brick pavement. You would think as that noise came closer to them they might consider looking up. However, not only did they not look up even when I was right next to them, they were just drifting along with their nose to the screen.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Eating Lunch</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Eating lunch with my co-workers the first day I remember glancing around the restaurant and everyone at every other table had their phones out and looking down. I won't say we don't do that in the US but it seemed like a lot more than where I live. Now some of this could just be Shanghai is a bigger city than the Minneapolis area and if I lived in a downtown setting I might notice this more often. That might be some of it but I am not 100% sure that is the whole reason as I have done my fair share of traveling in the US as well.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>My Take</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Whereas people in the US keep trying to make conscious efforts to stay away from their phones, China seems to be doing the opposite. The restaurant I was talking about earlier where everyone was on their phone some of it made more sense as I traveled more. You see in China even though you go to a restaurant and sit down, most of the time you end up ordering from your phone (thinking face). Yep, you heard that right, the people sitting at the tables and planning on eating it there ALL order and ALL pay by their phone. I can see some benefits on the payment side of things as you don't have to worry about them taking your credit card or dealing with cash. Also, I would assume a receipt would be instantly on your phone if you needed it for your records or business purposes. However, this whole situation is just another way to keep people engaged on their phone and not put them down.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In talking with a colleague on a different night, she explained that now she doesn't even carry cash or bank cards but just always keeps her phone on her. It sounds like everything is almost done by phones for them and that could be a major reason everyone seemed to be looking down. If you are in the habit of using it all the time for everything then it just becomes so ingrained in your daily life that you probably don‚Äôt even think about not looking at it when you are with others or completely alone walking the streets. It is a mere lifeline at this point in their culture as everything is becoming connected (kind of sounds like the Feed in the <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2019/05/14/breach-by-eliot.html\">Analog Series</a> of books ?).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":51123064,\"align\":\"center\",\"width\":557,\"height\":372} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/cb4a93c5bb.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-51123064\" width=\"557\" height=\"372\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>There could be some benefits here</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Even though this all sounds bad, I actually can‚Äôt believe how far along they have come technology wise. My last visit to China was 4 years ago and I still remember watching most people pay by cash or credit/bank cards. However, this time almost everything is digital and I was for sure an outsider paying by cash and credit card. They had to dust off the machine in the corner and even then a handwritten receipt was given to me as they didn't have a printer around. This is because most people in China just got it on their phones.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Even when traveling in Germany last year I found it interesting that they bring the payment terminal to your table and you watch them run your credit card. Those payment terminals needed to be connected in some fashion so they didn‚Äôt have to walk my card back to the main terminal. However, what I was noticing in China would be taking it one more notch up. They merely had a QR code somewhere on the table that you could scan and send the payment to if you didn‚Äôt already order from the phone.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As much as I don‚Äôt want to be so tied to my phone as I truly like putting it down once in a while. I would welcome having more things go digital like payments and receipts. I too do not like carrying my wallet around with lots of other stuff in it if I can avoid it. I can see that more things will be done by phone which will also require a lot more focus and discipline for myself to make sure it doesn't become the norm of always being on my phone. I want to be present and in the moment with my kids and not always be looking down at my phone. I do welcome this challenge as I really can see benefits.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><i><b>What do you think? Would having more things go digital be good or would you fear you would be tied even more to technology and it could bring bad habits along the way?</b></i></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

This time, however, the people who long ago were manipulating the feed are the only ones capable of saving it as an activist group is trying to destroy the credibility and power it possesses.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A stranger in hiding discovers that this group of powerful people wants to destroy the feed and she knows she needs to do something about it.  The stranger has been in hiding for so long trying to forget about the missteps of her past life knows that what is being discussed could hurt those that she was close to. She must decide if it is worth it to come out of hiding to help her friends that she abandoned long ago. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Prior to this Emily, who had manipulated a backdoor to the feed had no thought of going back and reconnecting with her past friends and acquaintances but after stumbling upon this plot to hurt those people she knew she couldn't sit idle.  As she weaves her way back into the lives of those she abandoned she reflects on her upbringing and what brought her to where she is today.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Honestly, I could go on and on about the story but I think you should pick up a copy yourself to read as I don't want to spoil anything that might give away how it ends.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Attention to <g class=\"gr_ gr_26 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"26\" data-gr-id=\"26\">detail</g></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As always, Eliot does great with the details. This is one of the many reasons I really enjoy reading his books. He writes in a way that paints a vivid picture of what the character is seeing, hearing and feeling as they go about the story. All of that further adds to the story as you feel you are part of the action.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Not to mention he does a great job drawing from current events and issues in the world today to bring this story that much closer to the very near future. Topics around student loans, schools effectiveness, and of course politics on a global scale just to name a few. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This story was tightly woven into the other two books of the Analog series by the characters, but Eliot also made sure the books could be read by themselves. Keep your eyes out for the easter eggs that he drops into the stories when he might reference other characters or places from other books he has written. I am sure I didn't catch them all but when I find something referencing a different book (not part of this series) it does put a smile on my face. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As with almost all of Eliot's books, I really enjoy the quotes and insights that are sprinkled about. In the various types of books I read, I don't normally pull out motivation from fiction books.  However, I am thinking Eliot does this on purpose as the character is normally trying to motivate themselves or others but the same statements can be used in everyday life. One that stuck out for me in this story is below.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:pullquote {\"className\":\"is-style-default\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote is-style-default\"><blockquote><p>Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time.

Not to mention if you have not read any of the books in this series I would suggest starting from the beginning as you can't go wrong.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I really do enjoy Eliot's books and his style of writing as you can tell. I can't wait to see what is up next for him as he continues to produce great work.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

I will be home for 2 weeks then a vacation with the whole family where we will be traveling for about a week. Once I get back from that I will have a weekend with the family before boarding a plane again. That time, however, will be an international trip which always adds to some travel complexities.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/57633f4393.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I typically don't mind traveling except that I have to be away from my family and potentially miss activities of theirs. However, what makes things worse is the pending appointments of flight departures. The hurry up and wait of it all is really nothing special. I am sure I was annoyed with it when I was fresh out of college traveling but maybe I didn‚Äôt care as much now. Or it might have been because I was so much younger and didn't have anything else going on.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What makes that even worse is when you have a flight later in the day and your whole day gets sucked into making sure you can leave on time. Or even worse then you feel you can't do anything all day as you want to make sure you leave at the optimal time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are too many variables when flying that sometimes suck the enjoyment out of air traveling. Let‚Äôs start from the top and work through a couple of items that make the pending appointment of air travel less fun.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Getting to the Airport</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Travel times, yep you know what I am talking about is there traffic and if so how bad is it?

If I drive, how long will it take me to park and get to the airport?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/4a4ceaf2af.gif\" width=\"600\" height=\"404\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><b>Security Line</b></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>How early should I really arrive?

Should I still go at the same time because remember that time the switch it to later and then the plane came in early and it wasn't as long as they said. How delayed do you think it will be? Will I make my connection? When will I get to my destination? Do you think the flight will be canceled? If so, how do I rebook or get a new flight?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/feb573bc16.gif\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You see all of those questions that run through your head and then you have to calculate the time back to your starting point of leaving the house. Not to mention if you have a flight later in the day you keep thinking about it and wondering if the time you planned to leave for the airport is right or if you should go earlier.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then after you think you have answered all of your questions for airplane travel, you realize you haven't consulted the <i><b>Weather</b></i>! Well, that throws a wrench into everything and you have to start at the top again to see how that might affect what you already decided on ideal departure.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/7cf496010d.gif\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><b>This seems out of place</b></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well hope you enjoyed these random thoughts while I sit in the airport for a 3 hr delayed flight that was supposed to leave at 8:30 pm but we are now not leaving till 11:30 pm and arriving around 2:30 am local time.

However, before I jump into my own thoughts I really think you should watch the video as he brings up some really good points on being Rich vs being Poor.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ROfBLx6bLZI\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n<h3>Recap</h3>\n\n<p>For a little recap, in case you didn‚Äôt watch the video but I really think you should, Casey boils it down to everyone has <strong><em>Life Problems</em></strong> which consist of Happiness, Love, Fulfillment, and Purpose (at a minimum). However, if you are poor on top of those problems you have the big gorilla which is <strong><em>Money Problems</em></strong> because you don‚Äôt know where you are going to live, how to put food on the table, take care of yourself when you are sick, or maybe even not sure how to get to your job without proper transportation.</p>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/bfdfb325c4.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you are like me, you are going to look at that list and agree with him that it is kind of straightforward. Poorer people are worried so much about money problems that when rich people say they can‚Äôt find their purpose in life and that money can‚Äôt solve their problems, we all jump off the rails because money would solve our problems. <br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>So let's take this one step further now‚Ä¶.</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are some people that are in-between this simple concept of <strong><em>Money</em></strong> and <strong><em>Life</em></strong> problems. In fact, most people probably fall in the middle of this easy example. I would take a guess that most of us think we have some sort of Money problems.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If we take a closer look at what we think are our money problems (or think we are poor), are we really just spending above our means. We feel we need a bigger house or extra vacations. Where in reality if we cut those out we could begin to look closer at those Life problems.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the video, the article that Casey references is from the NY Times and titled <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/21/magazine/elite-professionals-jobs-happiness.html\">America‚Äôs Professional Elite: Wealthy, Successful, and Miserable</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cduhigg\">Charles Duhig (@cduhigg)</a>. One part of the article that jumped out at me was a quote from the guy who made $1.2M a year and felt defeated in life said he was locked into a lifestyle that made cutting his pay impossible.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>He had received an offer at a start-up, and he would have loved to take it, but it paid half as much, and he felt locked into a lifestyle that made this pay cut impossible. ‚ÄúMy wife laughed when I told her about it,‚Äù he said.</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That right there is the true problem of what we all feel when we have moved out of the Poor category (i.e., basic needs being taken care of), we get locked into a new version of ourselves that moving backward would feel like we failed. So our new version of poor keeps increasing with us. I am guessing most people could probably take a different job and still not be <strong><u>poor</u></strong> assuming they could get their spending and priorities in order of what is important. That is work that not everyone is willing to take and it is also something that does not change overnight. Not many people want to downsize their house or give up that yearly trip to Disney with the kids.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Over the past years, I have read a lot of articles from Personal Finance and Minimalist bloggers and the thing that always sticks out to me is the underlying topic of living true to your priorities. Some of that is figuring out what your ‚Äúbasic needs‚Äù or ‚Äúminimum needs‚Äù are so then you can really figure out if changes can be made in your job/career to help you really tackle Life Problems that we all face. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>My thoughts / Take Aways</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I am not immune to this thing and it is something I always struggle with as I am sure most people do. My basic needs have been met so at the simplest form I really shouldn‚Äôt have any Money Problems. Moving past that, I boil it down to the two resources I have at my disposal in order to make my Life Problems either manageable or fixed. <strong>Time and Money</strong><br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Time and money are both resources at our disposal which is really all that is needed for most problems in our lives and possibly the world. The hard part is to figure out how to balance both of them in order to get an optimal outcome for yourself. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Note I said optimal outcome, as there is not always a perfect balance of having tons of money and tons of free time.</em><br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Each of these resources is needed for prioritizing things that are important to us. For example, if you continue to upgrade your lifestyle by buying the newest gadgets, bigger houses, and fancier cars because you feel it is the most important thing to do you might find yourself in a situation of having no way out. Similar to the guy in the story from the NY Times. All of your resources are being used to tackle a lifestyle you want to achieve and I am guessing that lifestyle gives you less time and money to find love, meaning, and happiness.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Minimalist Home: A Room-by-Room Guide to a Decluttered, Refocused Life by Joshua Becker overall is a great book for anyone that is looking to declutter their house and has possibly never done it before or just needs some more encouragement. However, if you have read other philosophies on decluttering or are 80% there, this book might not be for you then.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":51122732,\"align\":\"center\",\"width\":768,\"height\":512,\"linkDestination\":\"custom\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><a href=\" https://www.amazon.com/Minimalist-Home-Room-Room-Decluttered/dp/1601427999/?tag=stthink-20 \" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/0f0bd7da91.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-51122732\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>The Book</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Each part of the book is comprised of topics broken down into specific rooms to tackle and ideas that go along with it. Specifically, some of the chapters were around decluttering the following rooms:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Living Room and Family Room</li><li>Bedrooms and Guest Rooms</li><li>CLosets and Mudroom</li><li>Bathrooms and Laundry Room</li><li>Kitchen and Dining Room</li><li>Home Office</li><li>Storage, Hobby, and Toy Rooms</li><li>Garage and Yard</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The book did a good job of having a mix of tactical informing to get started, personal stories from Joshua, and then personal stories of others. I think each complimented the other and really enforced to the reader that you are not in this alone. There are people out there right now reading this ready to take the same steps as you as well as people like you who walked these same steps and here is their story, and mine.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In addition to the great steps and antidotes throughout the book, I really enjoyed the quick quotes sprinkled throughout. They are perfect to write down as a reminder of why you might be taking this journey.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Minimalism isn‚Äôt about removing things you love. It‚Äôs about removing the things that distract you from the things you love.</p><cite>Joshua Becker ‚Äì The Minimalist Home<br></cite></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is one thing I don‚Äôt remember from his other books and he called it a minimalism dividend. In short form, it is really just the savings or benefits you would get due to the fact you now have less stuff to take care of (e.g., <g class=\"gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"7\" data-gr-id=\"7\">maintenance</g> cost of items). There honestly <g class=\"gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"8\" data-gr-id=\"8\">is</g> so many benefits to living a more decluttered life and if you haven‚Äôt started your journey it could be hard to grasp. That is where this book does a good job of pointing out many of the benefits you could gain by reducing clutter instead of just organizing it nicely in a closet or storage facility.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>My own decluttering thoughts</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Never organize what you can discard.</p><cite> Joshua Becker ‚Äì The Minimalist Home </cite></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>From a personal perspective, that was one of the biggest things I learned through my decluttering process. I think back at all the time my wife and I were just trying to move things around in our house in order to be <strong><em>organized</em></strong>. Fast forward 10 years, with the knowledge we know now and we really just needed to get rid of stuff. I can‚Äôt even count the number of times we commented to each other that all we felt like we did was organize and move stuff around during our free weekends.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>ONLY Downside</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The only downside to this book for me is that I have read a lot of what Joshua Becker has written in book form (e.g., <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/05/31/the-more-of.html\">The More <g class=\"gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del\" id=\"5\" data-gr-id=\"5\">of</g> Less</a>), stories from his blog <a href=\"https://www.becomingminimalist.com/\">Becoming Minimalist</a>, in addition to taking his <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Uncluttered  (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://uncluttered.samcart.com/referral/kwVBIyfN/KLDewKhkPXB2B00D\" target=\"_blank\">Uncluttered</a>course. So from that token, nothing in the book was new to me and most of his personal stories were the same ones that I had heard before. That is why I said at the beginning if you are far along on a path to decluttering this book might not be right for you as it probably won‚Äôt be anything groundbreaking to get you to 100%.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Parting thoughts<br></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Even though I have followed Joshua Becker for some time, one of the best parts of this book is to hear other people's stories. Since the other stuff was not new, I enjoyed all of the other stories and hearing how other people have approached it and then after they completed what it means to them today. As I said before if you are looking to declutter your house and need somewhere to start I would definitely pick up this book as it really does a good job giving you a room-by-room guide to getting you started. If anything, I feel Joshua Becker does a great job in this area anyway so I would suggest you check out his blog (<a href=\"https://www.becomingminimalist.com/\">Becoming Minimalist</a>).<br><br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_text": "\n<p>I have been at a standstill for the last three months since I had posted a hand full of new articles. As the days clicked by I finally decided I should really think about it as I would put pressure on myself to push publish but ultimately nothing ever happened.</p>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/6e45bb9f83.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n<p><em>Now before I get too far along this isn't one of those I was too busy or I forgot about posting for the last couple of months. I will say there has been too much on my mind about the content to post and not enough time to finish it out.</em>Ôªø</p>\n\n<p>I was excited to post the follow-ups for <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2018/11/05/media-consumption.html\">Media Consumption</a> and the <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2018/11/29/floodgates-of-unnecessary.html\">Floodgates of Unnecessary Purchases</a> as I had some more thoughts on each of those subjects. In fact, right now I have 5 posts ready to publish today if I wanted to but where I keep getting caught up is do I really want to publish them on this site or do I want to release them if/when I change this site name in the upcoming days... weeks... months... years... It seems like I keep thinking of changing it up and that keeps making me push out my timeline of posting stuff I already have done.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Over Thinking Might be the Problem</h3>\n\n<p>I am not worried about the change in general but I am wrestling in my mind with what this site should be or what the new site should become. That is where I hit my standstill. Here is some of what keeps going through my head:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>For the best results shouldn't I publish similar types of material and not be all over the place?</li><li>My longer form articles are around finance, minimalism, habits, or working on focusing, so I should probably only publish that type of material.</li><li>If I start a new site should I only write about those things there and let the other stuff just fade out into the Interwebs.</li><li>I could run two different types of blogs one for more specific content and then one of other random stuff?</li></ul>\n\n<h3>So what should I do?</h3>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/f076710431.jpg\" width=\"322\" height=\"373\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>I was going to just pose this as a question to anyone reading if you have been in a similar situation or what other questions would you ask me? However, as I thought of what to title this random post I realized the word Standstill came to mind. It seemed fitting because instead of publishing what I write, I have just been at a standstill. No new site, and no new posts.</p>\n\n<h3>Looking back and moving forward</h3>\n\n<p>At this moment, I realize that I need to pull back from trying to craft the articles that might do well and get shared across all of social media. In my current situation I just like writing about things I see, stuff that is making me think, or interesting stuff I find online. This is more of a creative outlet that was never started with optimizing my audience or more specifically making money. Looking back I didn't have a direction of where I wanted to take this it was just a place to share things. </p>\n\n<p>Over the last two years, I realized I had lost that as I kept thinking I should switch my topics/publishing style to match some of the people I follow that are super successful. That is them and that is not me nor at this time do I really want it to be me. I don't want to be bound by what I post about as it would be forcing me to pretend in a way. I know it could be beneficial in the long term if I would just <b>niche down</b> but at this time that is not going to happen but I am sure common themes will be present in my posts.</p>\n\n<p>Hope you stick with me as the future is unknown üòâ</p>\n",

The list of what that decision might have been or could be a number of different things.¬† For example, your job, family, friends, or finances to name a few common ones.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\"You're always only one decision away from a totally different life\"</p><cite>unknown</cite></blockquote>\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/44858eeb59.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>I really like that quote as it does ring true for myself and probably many of you. Well, at least the thought that a decision we made previously might have led us down a different path which then causes us to stop and think. However, other times it is something small that came and went. In fact, every day you are faced with some sort of decision that will lead you to the path you are today and not to the path you maybe could be on.</p>\n\n<p>One of the reasons I like that quote above is circling back to the life you want. You might think things haven‚Äôt turned out like you had hoped it would or you wish you would have done something different in your past. I am as guilty as the next person and I keep going back to things I maybe should have done or shouldn't have done. I am trying to get away from that as it isn't really healthy as you never really know what would have happened because you might have still chosen a different path again and been worse off.</p>\n\n<h3>Small Steps Forward</h3>\n\n<p>If you think about that quote again and think of it as making life choices to move towards a goal you would like. What is a small step you could take to move yourself to where you would like to be? You just need to start changing habits or creating habits that will move you to your life goal. That is the best place to start instead of thinking about what you might have missed out on because of the choices you made.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><i>While writing this I was reminded of a video Anthony Ongaro at <a href=\"https://www.breakthetwitch.com/\">Break the Twitch</a> published which ties in nicely with this topic and is called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WX81NSRVV5U\">One Small Change That Creates Massive Results</a>. Check it out and follow his work for more great nuggets of information.</i></pre>\n\n<h3>How has it worked for me?</h3>\n\n<p>For me personally, I tried to do this last year and I will say for 9 months of this year I failed at the approach of small steps as I was taking too many small steps in too many different areas of my life which resulted in ZERO changes. However, about 2 months ago I spent some time really thinking about what I wanted my future to look like. Not necessarily the big dream future as I have always tried to think about it previously but just looking out a couple months to a year for things like family vacations, job, and fitness.</p>\n\n<h3>Second attempt</h3>\n\n<p>Fitness and vacation goals were easy to think about but the execution in those required focus on a day in and day out basis. This is where breaking those things down into little bits I could tackle has really paid dividends. Really it was making small decisions of prioritizing if I wanted to move to my goals of vacation and fitness or put my resources (time/money) into something else.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/6e5e350640.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" />\n*It takes small steps to reach the top or your goal. Take your time step by step.*\n\n<p>For careers, this is a more difficult task as it isn't something that can be changed instantly as you are more than likely not going to quit your job today and hope for the best. For me this probably too a lot more energy thinking about as I know what I am doing today isn‚Äôt necessarily what I want to be doing in 5-10 years from now. So instead of just trying to shoot for the stars now, I had to think about what is either holding me in my current role or preventing me from getting into another role or a similar role at another company. The answer was easier than I thought but one that is oftentimes hard to feel like you can accomplish‚Ä¶ Money and Experience!</p>\n\n\n<p>This is where starting to take small steps today like saving more money as changes in careers might have you moving from a higher salary to a lower one initially. So making sure you can have more in the bank and in turn live off less will help make that move more achievable when the opportunity presents itself.</p>\n\n<p>Gaining more experience can be more challenging depending on if you are changing careers or just wanting a similar role at another company. Either way, you probably need to get more experience or else you would already be in that new role. In both cases this can come from volunteering, experimenting on your own time, or trying to see if you can gain more skills for your next role in your current role.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p>As you can see from a career standpoint, it is definitely a bigger hill to climb but the process of taking small steps towards and the end goal of what you want is how you have to ultimately start it.</p>\n\n<h3>Final thoughts</h3>\n\n<p>What keeps me moving is making sure I make decisions based on what I value or believe in as well as trying to stay positive. Knowing whatever decision I make I will own and do my best to keep the ball moving towards my goal based on my values. I know if I do that I will less likely keep wondering <b>what if </b>as I will have better reasons and purpose behind the path I choose.</p>\n",

It started with the question of how can I pack most efficiently as I didn‚Äôt want to check baggage through since I wanted to be somewhat mobile on the weekend. So as I was looking over my typical packing, which is normally pretty minimal as for a week travel in the US I use my <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Kelty-22632716BK-Versant-Duffel-Bag/dp/B015GXULLI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=stthink-20\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kelty Versant Duffel</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":51122702,\"align\":\"center\",\"width\":576,\"height\":432} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/dfc2c87ef8.jpg\" alt=\"Kelty Versant Duffel\" class=\"wp-image-51122702\" width=\"576\" height=\"432\"/><figcaption>I even pack my laptop in this bag on most trips in the US I take for work. Remember I love to run so there is running gear in there too!¬†</figcaption></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, knowing I was going to be gone longer and over the weekend, I knew I would use a little bigger bag but really wanted to try to squeeze everything into a small carry-on suitcase order to make travel from hotel to hotel much easier. So I decided to update my list a little bit before I knew it I was looking at my things and thinking there was probably something better than I could buy instead of taking similar items that I currently own.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>The Problem Started Brewing</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While packing my clothes I got this idea that if I bought some pants that would be comfortable enough to wear walking around but still look nice enough to wear to work a couple days over the trip that would be money worthwhile. So what did I do, what everyone does when they want something by heading to Amazon. However, it didn‚Äôt stop there‚Ä¶</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I wanted to work out so I was going to take some running shoes, however, the ones I had wouldn‚Äôt work for casual at work and running as they are bright yellow and pretty worn at this point. Speaking of shoes though, maybe I should just get some new casual / dress shoes so I might not have to bring my actual dress shoes. Don‚Äôt you think some new socks are in order too? Also, I didn‚Äôt want to take my two phones along (long story), so I needed to buy a new phone workout band for the time I was away. Finally, I needed a different phone charger as the long cord just wouldn‚Äôt cut it as I didn‚Äôt want all that excess cord in my pocket when it was charging on the go. Before I knew it I had a list of ‚Äú<b>Needs</b>‚Äù that probably totaled more than $400 and in 2 days boxes started showing up from Amazon.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You see what just happened there, it was so easy for my mind to justify purchasing and elevated things from a ‚Äú<b>Want</b>‚Äù to a ‚Äú<b>Need</b>‚Äù prior to my work trip. Once I had my mindset on packing light, I opened the floodgates of unnecessary purchases and I ended up with things I typically wouldn‚Äôt have bought myself till it was absolutely necessary.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Backpedaling to my Frugal Self</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the end, I came to my senses before it was too late and started to backpedal on what was really a need for this trip. Thankfully all of the items I had purchased had free returns. I did still end up keeping some of them and I feel good about it to this day as I know I have used them every week since.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":51122701,\"align\":\"center\",\"width\":576,\"height\":768} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/b188c5c1ad.jpg\" alt=\"K√∂lner Dom - Cologne Cathedral, Germany\" class=\"wp-image-51122701\" width=\"576\" height=\"768\"/><figcaption>Walking down the steep steps of the Cologne Cathedral!</figcaption></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"fontSize\":\"small\"} -->\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><i>Ok, two more plugs as I am still running in those <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GU9N8HQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=stthink-20\">Asics shoes</a> above and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H9ME25G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=stthink-20\">prAna pants</a> are amazing too.

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In my overall quest to minimize distractions in my life either by limiting the time I spend on social media or watching TV. Lately, I have noticed that I probably have been overconsuming in other areas, specifically Podcasts, Books (both Audio and Paperbacks), and online news articles and blogs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>TV isn't my problem</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>During my recent travels, I thought back to when I used to travel and I would get back to the hotel and turn on the TV to find random shows to waste the rest of the night away. I have found when traveling now, once I get back to the hotel in the evening I don‚Äôt even think about turning the TV on. To be fair, that is something I don‚Äôt do at home either but for some reason, I notice it more in Hotels as they always have this big screen right in front of the bed that you can see from all places of the room. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/374ea55f82.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" />\n*The TV in the room is just calling you, above the desk and right in front of the bed too.*\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The hotel I was at last time was a Suite which had two big-screen TVs that were so close together that using the remote on the one in front of the bed would also turn on the one above the desk. Note there wasn‚Äôt even a wall between these two rooms. Not to mention, some hotels I have stayed at over the past year even have my name on it asking me to log into all my other accounts almost like it is calling me :)</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/870aaf52f4.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"332\" alt=\"\" />\n*Who needs two TVs this close together? NO ONE!*\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So what do I do instead of watching TV? Typically that is when I would read the latest Blog posts of people I regularly follow, listen to a Podcast or an Audiobook, or sometimes I will just lay in bed or sit on the couch and actually read a book. I typically don‚Äôt ‚Äúread‚Äù books as often as I am listening to books but I still do find time to just sit and read books from time to time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>What types of Media do you Consume</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All of this other media consumption that I would typically say is better than watching hours of TV or spending hours browsing social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) I am now wondering if it should be cut back on as well. I have realized that I sometimes get so consumed in them that before I know it I have accomplished nothing else on my long list of things I would like to accomplish like writing (on this blog is a good point), creating something new, running (yes I am weird like that), or even calling a friend.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Everyone is always saying we spend so much time on Social Media and watching TV shows or movies online. However, how much time do we spend consuming other media, and is that starting to move towards an area of concern? I could easily make the argument that it is better than other things but it also is taking away from me doing something else I enjoy. I don‚Äôt have a good answer on that one but since it has crossed my mind I am definitely going to look closer and possibly keep track of how much time in a given week I spend on these other forms of information consumption.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Now it is your turn, do you think you over consume other types of media?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>In full disclosure, this post has been written since April and I keep coming back to it as I am not sure if I was ready to hit publish. I have added some parts here and there over the months leading up to when I actually hit publish but I finally decided to just hit publish and I am sure I will have more on this topic at a later point in time.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

A subtle underlying story of the book is how Diana is trying to figure out how to avoid second-guessing herself, putting trust in others, all while battling mentors and others from her past. While she is dealing with her own internal struggles, she needs to stay sharp in order to put a stop to others taking over one of the world's most important resources.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Attention to <g class=\"gr_ gr_26 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"26\" data-gr-id=\"26\">detail</g></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"left\"} -->\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">The one thing I have really enjoyed about this series is how it talks about the feed but never does Eliot really describe how the feed is connected to us or what it really is. I think it is great to leave that abstract out as we each have our own thoughts and images of what that might actually look like. Also based on how the characters in the book use/talk about the feed you continue to create in your mind what that looks like.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the things I appreciate about Eliot's books is the realistic¬†characters,¬†their struggles, and overall attention to detail. Even though the book is written in a near-future time, he used tools at his disposal to map/chart out what the world would have looked like and the paths the characters could have taken.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, as with all of Eliot's books there are hidden Easter Eggs for you to find where he may reference other books he has written. It always brings a smile to my face as I know it isn't always easy to tie books from different series together but a lot of authors do it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you are looking for a good book to read as the colder months are approaching I would definitely pick this book up as it really grabs your attention from the first page and keeps you wanting more.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally, Eliot has another book in this series that is schedule to be released in May 2019 titled \"<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Breach-Analog-Novel-Eliot-Peper/dp/1542044596/?tag=stthink-20\" rel=\"nofollow\">Breach</a>\" that I for one am excited to see what is next.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

As always, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/trippandtyler\">Tripp and Tyler</a> have done it again by giving everyone a glips into how it sometimes goes down.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {\"url\":\"[youtu.be/0FnltJ3GY...](https://youtu.be/0FnltJ3GYus)\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n[youtu.be/0FnltJ3GY...](https://youtu.be/0FnltJ3GYus)\n</div></figure>\n<!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>My Thoughts</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have to admit as much as I enjoyed the video, I can't remember the last time I had rental car issues.&nbsp; However, since travel frequently most companies have my profile on file that allows me to walk up and grab a car and drive away. Avoiding that discussion with a sales agent trying to get me to buy more. I remember when that wasn't the case and I felt they were trying to sell me every part of the car and all I got was the shell. I just remember being confused what was really included in the quote when I ordered the car.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Airlines are in this game as well but to varying degrees&nbsp;based on the airline, you travel. It seems more airlines are going in this direction as well and it is really disappointing but a the same time I get what they are trying to do. They are trying to make people feel they are getting a great price at the time of purchase only to find out it didn't include everything. The worst part is all of these \"fees\" really add up for airlines and more than likely going to the <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/2018/02/airlines-profit-comes-when-you-pay-baggage-and-change-fees/\">bottom line</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is very common these days that if you are not a regular flyer or have a credit card for the airline you are flying you&nbsp;more than likely will have to pay baggage fees. Some airlines are now going to start charging customers for full size carry on's depending on the ticket you purchase (<em>Thanks&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.united.com/ual/en/us/fly/travel/baggage/carry-on.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">United!</a></em>) Then, of course, there have been the odd one from a while back where one airline was charging people to use the bathroom. Yes, the Bathroom. I believe that didn't stick around but you can see that you need to be careful when booking travel and make sure you know what you bought.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What are your thoughts? Do you think companies should just give you one flat cost and have everything included? Or should they give you a base price and then have you pay for upgrades / additional services.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Wow is it really that time again? Time to end another year and start the next.</p>\n<p>It really seems strange to say goodbye to 36 and hello to 37. I think saying 37 seems so odd to me as it is that much closer to 40 and 30 seems so long ago.</p>\n<p>This past year was one of the big ups and big downs. The family road trip that we took from Minnesota to Maine last summer was a huge success and the kids had a blast. In fact, the fear of the 26-hour car ride was very eventless as there wasn‚Äôt much complaining by the kids (or parents) at all on the way out or the 2-day trek back. Our family is definitely ready to hit the road again and are making plans for a West Coast trip in 2019.</p>\n<p>This past year I did do a good job of slowing my own busy schedule down in a couple of areas (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Slowing Down to Redirect<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). I am going to continue to focus on this going forward as I want to challenge myself in the time I spend in various side/volunteer projects and make sure I am getting out of it what I would expect.</p>\n<p>However, this year brought on more sadness as 13-year-old Yorkshire Terrier <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PJ<!-- raw HTML omitted --> passed away and now for the first time in 14 years, we don‚Äôt have any pets in the house. It feels very quiet and I do miss having a four-legged friend following me around from time to time but I am not ready to get another one yet.</p>\n<p>Additionally, not long after that, I had to say goodbye to my Grandma as well. It is not the first death I have ever had to deal with but it was one of the firsts where I actually went to see her days before and tell her goodbye in person. When the person is completely coherent and knows she is waiting for the time, it makes it that much more surreal when you take a step back. There is always things you wish you would have done with the person or talked to the person about before that point but it give you one last chance to say something to them that you know they are hearing and responding to you about.</p>\n<p>Right after both of those sad events, I pretty much boarded a plane and had to spend two weeks in Germany on a work trip. I felt bad leaving my wife and kids for so long but it was an experience that I really enjoyed and can‚Äôt wait to take my wife to Germany in the future. Almost all of the trip was work-related but over the weekend I spent my time in Cologne which was amazing. It is mind-blowing how much history can be in one city and how far back some of the buildings (and ruins under the city) date. My last whole week in Germany was spent working in our Berlin office, that also was also very interesting as there is so much history in that city from WWI, WWII and the Berlin Wall. In fact, it was interesting just talking to the people at my company that lived through the time the wall was up and how it affected their families.</p>\n<p>Towards the end of 2017 and into the start of 2018, my new word that will carry me through is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->focus<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I guess you could say year 37 will be the year of focusing‚Ä¶ On what you ask?

				"content_text": "Wow is it really that time again? Time to end another year and start the next.\n\nIt really seems strange to say goodbye to 36 and hello to 37. I think saying 37 seems so odd to me as it is that much closer to 40 and 30 seems so long ago.\n\nThis past year was one of the big ups and big downs. The family road trip that we took from Minnesota to Maine last summer was a huge success and the kids had a blast. In fact, the fear of the 26-hour car ride was very eventless as there wasn‚Äôt much complaining by the kids (or parents) at all on the way out or the 2-day trek back. Our family is definitely ready to hit the road again and are making plans for a West Coast trip in 2019.\n\nThis past year I did do a good job of slowing my own busy schedule down in a couple of areas (<a href=\"hhttps://ericmwalk.blog/2017/10/03/slowing-down-to.html\">Slowing Down to Redirect</a>). I am going to continue to focus on this going forward as I want to challenge myself in the time I spend in various side/volunteer projects and make sure I am getting out of it what I would expect.\n\nHowever, this year brought on more sadness as 13-year-old Yorkshire Terrier <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2018/02/06/princess-jezzabella.html\">PJ</a> passed away and now for the first time in 14 years, we don‚Äôt have any pets in the house. It feels very quiet and I do miss having a four-legged friend following me around from time to time but I am not ready to get another one yet.\n\nAdditionally, not long after that, I had to say goodbye to my Grandma as well. It is not the first death I have ever had to deal with but it was one of the firsts where I actually went to see her days before and tell her goodbye in person. When the person is completely coherent and knows she is waiting for the time, it makes it that much more surreal when you take a step back. There is always things you wish you would have done with the person or talked to the person about before that point but it give you one last chance to say something to them that you know they are hearing and responding to you about.\n\nRight after both of those sad events, I pretty much boarded a plane and had to spend two weeks in Germany on a work trip. I felt bad leaving my wife and kids for so long but it was an experience that I really enjoyed and can‚Äôt wait to take my wife to Germany in the future. Almost all of the trip was work-related but over the weekend I spent my time in Cologne which was amazing. It is mind-blowing how much history can be in one city and how far back some of the buildings (and ruins under the city) date. My last whole week in Germany was spent working in our Berlin office, that also was also very interesting as there is so much history in that city from WWI, WWII and the Berlin Wall. In fact, it was interesting just talking to the people at my company that lived through the time the wall was up and how it affected their families.\n\nTowards the end of 2017 and into the start of 2018, my new word that will carry me through is <b>focus</b>. I guess you could say year 37 will be the year of focusing‚Ä¶ On what you ask? Nothing particular and everything :)\n\nI am looking forward to what 37 will now bring to me I know there will probably be new adventures and changes of some sort. Describing it as the year of focus will definitely mean that certain things will need to change as I am focusing in on various areas of my life that are most important to me. As always some changes will be quick and others will be a long game approach but setting the steps today for later down the road.\n\nI look forward to checking in next year...\n\nPreviously: <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/03/24/thirtyfive.html\">35</a>, <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2017/03/24/thirtysix.html\">36</a> ..\n",

				"content_text": "Year 2 has come and gone‚Ä¶ As I am excited to see another year of people using the Blogging Meetup, I hold back a little bit as I know I have been very distanced from it in the last year as I was working to prioritize various extra projects in my life last year.\n<h4><b>Look back at Year 2</b></h4>\nMy thoughts haven‚Äôt changed though as I really enjoy this little side project and I intend to keep it around. In fact, as of today, we have 450 people registered on the site. That is up 67 from last year where we had 383 users on the site. Maybe when we hit 500 we should have an online party :)! Now only because I am a numbers guru I want to show you the stats of the last two years by month. As you can see it is trending down and in about August last year it started declining faster. In fact, February this year looks like it will only be about half of last year.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/c3365db595.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"265\" alt=\"\" />  \n\n<h4><b>Peeling back the Numbers</b></h4>\nI didn‚Äôt need to dig into the site stats to produce the chart above as I already had an idea of what the results were going to be. If you have looked at the site a couple of times in the last months it is mostly the same handful of people posting over and over. Not that there is nothing wrong with that as I am glad people are using it as established and it seems like there is another handful of users that look at the site on a daily basis. However, I still find it troubling that there is less engagement on the site than I hoped there would have been. Though for that problem of engagement, I hold myself accountable for a good portion of the blame as I know that there need to be more ‚Äúthings‚Äù (e.g., prompts, events, topic discussions) or things to get people engaged in the site. In fact, over the past year, I slowly had forgotten to keep up with the Like, Follow, Share Monday prompts. I think that generated good engagement for readers and hopefully gave some bloggers a nice bump in stats are people were going to check out their site.\n\nOn the positive side of things, I was happy to finally finish the <a href=\"https://bloggingmeetup.com/memberposts/\">Members post page</a> which is really just an RSS feed from all members sites. However, on the flip side, I am not sure if people have found it useful or worthwhile. Some of that is I am not able to get any stats from it so unsure if links are being clicked on or not.\n<h4><b>Next Steps</b></h4>\nSo that brings me to today where I have been neglecting this site and trying to figure out what to do next. I would love to get feedback from anyone on what they think should be done with this site. Nothing is a bad idea as I still think a Blogging Community makes sense but maybe this implementation/version of it isn‚Äôt working anymore. Maybe the site needs to be more like a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/\">BuddyPress</a> that can be more conversational, or forum-based like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-discussion-board/\">Discussion Board</a>, or maybe even just a big <a href=\"https://slack.com/\">Slack</a> group.\n\nIn the short term, however, I am going to figure out a way to kick off the like follow share again but maybe I will try to incorporate it with the RSS feeds from members' sites in order to get people looking at something that is newly posted. Over the next several months I am going to really take a hard look at the Blogging Meetup and see where this site should be taken. I am going to hope for feedback from the community as I don‚Äôt want to just make this decision alone.\n<h4>Summary</h4>\nYear two was still a good year for the Blogging Meetup as people were still using the site as it was originally intended. However, during the beginning of year 3, it is time to figure out what the next chapter of this site is going to look like to make sure it is still meaningful to everyone going forward.\n\n<i><b>What do you think the next year of the Blogging Meetup should look like?

				"title": "Princess Jezzabella",
				"content_html": "<p>A little over a week ago we had to make another tough decision in our house as our last dog Princess Jezzabella the Diva of Pink aka PJ was put down. It was honestly like deja vu all over again as my wife and I have talked about it since the passing of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tucker<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a year and a half ago. We honestly never thought PJ was going to survive without him but she proved us wrong. In fact, I feel like she changed her normal behavior of a dog who kept to herself into one wanting more attention and love from us than ever before.</p>\n<p>PJ had been with us for 13 years, with another birthday knocking on the door this June 21st. She was the second of our &ldquo;kids&rdquo;, and she has lived in Michigan (where we got her from), Illinois and Minnesota. It was a really tough decision to make, one that we thought two years ago would have been easier than it really was. However, with the different version of PJ over the last couple of years becoming closer with our kids and the fact that we would then soon be a household with no pets for the first time in the last 15 years.</p>\n<p>In these final weeks she was throwing up almost daily and her breathing was sounding labored. This was on top of her eyesight fading as well as her hearing is going as well. So she would often bark at us and get scared as people would move around the house or come near her. Not that we will ever know how much pain she was in but we could tell she was not enjoying life as she knew it anymore.</p>\n<p>We believe our decision was right as we saw her health declining we didn&rsquo;t want her to suffer from day to day. Also, selfishly we didn&rsquo;t want her last days to be ones where we would be angry that she was throwing up all over and barking at us constantly.</p>\n<p>As with our first dog, we wanted to be with her until the end and in our minds, that was again non-negotiable. We ended up using the same place that comes out to your house and performs the procedure with you being able to be right next to them.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Finally around 5:20 we got the knock on the door and we knew that our time was finally up. It was a little harder this time as we knew what was going to happen and who knows PJ probably knew as well. I am glad that we could be with her the entire time as I still think it would be just as hard dropping her off someplace and then turning around and walking the other way.</p>\n<p>PJ, you truly were an amazing dog and I will miss you dearly. You never were the super cuddle bunny that Tucker was but you stepped up and filled that void in a time we needed it most.

				"content_text": "A little over a week ago we had to make another tough decision in our house as our last dog Princess Jezzabella the Diva of Pink aka PJ was put down. It was honestly like deja vu all over again as my wife and I have talked about it since the passing of <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2016/10/07/tucker-buddy.html\">Tucker</a> a year and a half ago. We honestly never thought PJ was going to survive without him but she proved us wrong. In fact, I feel like she changed her normal behavior of a dog who kept to herself into one wanting more attention and love from us than ever before.\n\nPJ had been with us for 13 years, with another birthday knocking on the door this June 21st. She was the second of our \"kids\", and she has lived in Michigan (where we got her from), Illinois and Minnesota. It was a really tough decision to make, one that we thought two years ago would have been easier than it really was. However, with the different version of PJ over the last couple of years becoming closer with our kids and the fact that we would then soon be a household with no pets for the first time in the last 15 years.\n\nIn these final weeks she was throwing up almost daily and her breathing was sounding labored. This was on top of her eyesight fading as well as her hearing is going as well. So she would often bark at us and get scared as people would move around the house or come near her. Not that we will ever know how much pain she was in but we could tell she was not enjoying life as she knew it anymore.\n\nWe believe our decision was right as we saw her health declining we didn't want her to suffer from day to day. Also, selfishly we didn't want her last days to be ones where we would be angry that she was throwing up all over and barking at us constantly.\n\nAs with our first dog, we wanted to be with her until the end and in our minds, that was again non-negotiable. We ended up using the same place that comes out to your house and performs the procedure with you being able to be right next to them.\n<h4>Final Day</h4>\nWe all tried to spend as much time with PJ as we could on the final day. I took her for a walk in the morning which I normally never do. Since it was a Sunday, we didn‚Äôt have as many commitments during the afternoon, so we were able to spend more time with her but since the weather was cold out we were unable to just be outside most of the day. However, while grocery shopping in the morning, my youngest and I decided to pick up some Frosty Paws <i>(Dog Ice Cream if you don‚Äôt know)</i> as well as a stuffed toy to let her play within the afternoon. When we got home and my daughter gave her the stuffed toy and PJ just sniffed it right away but it didn't really phase her too much. So I walked over to the toy, picked it up and gave it a squeeze, to which the toy made a squeaking sound and then I tossed it. Instantly, PJ seemed young again as she attacked the toy. She instantly grabbed hold of it and started shaking it violently and tossing it around and then jumping on it again. You see for some reason PJ has always had this thing about stuffed animals with squeakers in it. She is so persistent about disabling the squeaker that she will shred the toy and remove all stuffing just to find the squeaker and destroy it. Once she accomplishes this, she will not really play with the toy again. We had fun watching her play with the new toy and eventually moved on to the Frosty Paws that she really enjoys. After that, it was getting late in the afternoon and I figured since I couldn‚Äôt take an evening walk with her that now was probably the best time. It felt so strange walking down the same path we had so many times over the last year and a half, knowing it would be the last time. It is not that I will never walk on that path as it leads to a Lending Library by our house, but I knew I would be walking with more purpose other times as I wouldn‚Äôt have a dog to take on this walk after today.\n\nFinally around 5:20 we got the knock on the door and we knew that our time was finally up. It was a little harder this time as we knew what was going to happen and who knows PJ probably knew as well. I am glad that we could be with her the entire time as I still think it would be just as hard dropping her off someplace and then turning around and walking the other way.\n\nPJ, you truly were an amazing dog and I will miss you dearly. You never were the super cuddle bunny that Tucker was but you stepped up and filled that void in a time we needed it most. In fact, maybe it was always in your nature but you just let Tucker fill that role as you liked to be the ferocious protector. Thanks again for the times you were there for me and making my life a little bit better/more exciting. You will always be remembered.\n\n[gallery type=\"rectangular\" ids=\"51122500,51122502,51120912,51122505,51122503,51122501,51122510,51122499,51122504,51121571,51122511,51122512,51122509,51122508,51122507,51122506,51122498,51122513,51122495,51122514\"]\n\n&nbsp;\n",

It was in my early time using Twitter and started following people and companies in the Twin Cities. One day I finally realized that a couple guys and a company I was following, kept talking about this event as the weather was getting colder. As it turns out the company was SportsNgin (now called <a href=\"https://SportsEngine.com\">SportsEngine</a>), who was the major sponsor of the event and the guys who kept talking about it worked there and as luck would have it we're the co-founders of the company (Justin and Carson). I decided to do some reading about the event and found out it was a big deal and that it was happening in January. To top it off, they were looking for volunteers and I figured what better way to spend a day off work than being outside.\n\n<i>So you decided to take a day off work and volunteer to stand on the ice for 8 hours in what could be really cold January weather?</i>\n\nFair question, this probably piqued my interest more as I had just acquired the used materials for a <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2014/11/12/the-season-is.html/\">backyard rink</a> and was in the process of getting it ready for the cold. So as I was hearing about and seeing all of these pictures online of skating in the middle of a lake on an actual pond, I now wanted to see this event in person and watch some games.\n\n<em>Quick side story, I grew up in Iowa and have never played hockey in my life or really ice-skated in any prolonged amount of time. I used to rollerblade and play roller hockey in the street but nothing on the ice.</em>\n\n<h4>Side benefits of volunteering</h4>\nFor what started out to be a random event that I volunteered at, actually ended up being a place I meet a lot of interesting people. Some of these people were ones that I had interacted with on social media before and now that we were meeting face to face it was like we knew each other already. Also, the tournament brings in a bunch of people from all around the state of Minnesota, across the US, and even a couple countries, so it was always fun chatting with people to figure out where they came from and their background stories of playing hockey. That is one of the side benefits of volunteering in an area outside of your ‚Äúnormal‚Äù zone, you get to meet people you probably wouldn't have in your life. Every year since then I have enjoyed volunteering at the USPHC like the first. I continue to meet amazing people as well as keep in touch with some from previous years. Also, I get to spend a morning being outside on a big sheet of ice enjoying what nature has to offer (warm or cold). Through the years lots of efficiencies have been made in the Tournament operations as they have really upped their game, but at the core, it has stayed true to its roots of just getting people to play hockey outside as intended.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/f57849a3c5.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\" />  \n\n<h4>Next year...</h4>\nWhen you start to think about it 5 years is a long time to do anything in my opinion. Even though I couldn't help out this year, I hope to make it to Nakomis and watch a couple of games. It really is an exciting event to watch in person and I haven't experienced anything quite like it.\n\nIf you have made it this far and want to see what it looks like check out the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL6zifIbpfnZph47xgohFWQ\">US Pond Hockey Championships YouTube channel</a> as they have some amazing videos from 2016 and 2017.

				"content_text": "<p>In our journey of living a more intentional life by decluttering our belongings and owning less. We have recently found out that house projects have helped us make larger strides in this overall journey.</p>\n\n<p>Owning an older house provides you with lots of fun opportunities to work on <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2012/03/15/master-bathroom-remodel.html\">projects</a> that might include: updating rooms by painting or carpeting; discovering issues or fixing leaks that need a professional or home handyman; or even just finding a room that needs a full remodel like an outdated kitchen.</p>\n\n<p>My wife and I have done all of the above over the last 9 years we have lived in our house. The worst part of any housing project is that you have to move all of your belongings from the area the project is taking place to another area. For most of our house projects up till a couple years ago, we would move everything from one place to another and then move it ALL back once we were done.</p>\n\n<p>However, in the past couple of years, my wife and I have realized that we need to use those disruptions in our normal space and be very mindful of what we put back once it is all done. In looking back, we have probably moved every piece of furniture, toys, books, boxes, pictures, or other items from one room to another as kids changed rooms and home projects happened. It would have made too much sense during those moves to time to take the extra couple of minutes to set things aside and only slowly add back what is truly needed.</p>\n\n<p>It probably wasn't until this latest project of our Kitchen remodel that we really took hold of this idea. We moved everything out of our Kitchen, Dining Room, and Living room as we had the wall separating all of those removed. It was a messy process that allows our family of 5 to get really cozy in the basement that only has 2 bedrooms.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the process by which we packed everything away but the couple single sets of kitchen stuff we needed follows that of what Ryan from <a href=\"https://www.theminimalists.com/packing/\">The Minimalists</a> described as a <b>packing party</b>. However, I am always under the mindset that you don‚Äôt really need a term or reason, you just need to figure out what works well for you. We are still on this long journey of slowly decluttering room by room and figuring out what makes sense for our family of 5 as we cannot take on too much at once or it would be utter chaos in our life.</p>\n\n<p>Once our kitchen was finished and it was time to move everything back in we only moved in things we needed and made sure it had a purpose. For the kitchen, this was really easy as everything was in boxes we only brought stuff out that we used for cooking on a daily or weekly basis. A couple things we noticed during this process were:</p>\n\n<ul><li><b>Coffee Cups (or drinkware)</b> - I love coffee but really who needs to have around 30 coffee cups. I am not sure who we were planning on inviting over for coffee or hot chocolate but we realized that was way too many.</li><li><b>Tupperware</b> - How can we have so much of this and nothing matches. Where did all the lids to the small-sized containers go and why am I stuck with so many large lids with no containers. Let's just say we didn‚Äôt keep a lot and have paired this down so we can always find a lid and dish.</li><li><b>Cooking Utensils </b>- Don‚Äôt get me wrong it is always great to have a spare but I am not sure we needed 10 spatulas. It was more than likely we only needed 2-3 as we used the same one most of the time.</li><li><b>Mismatched stuff </b>- During our cleaning out we found lots of plates, cups, and other items that were not a full set even though we had one full nice set already. These were perfect candidates to not work back into the cycle as one cup isn‚Äôt as good as a nice set of 12.</li></ul>\n\n<p>There were lots of other examples of that were we just had lots or multiples of items that we didn‚Äôt need to continue to keep around cluttering up shelves or drawers.</p>\n\n<p>In the living and dining rooms, our goal was to remove excess furniture and things on the wall to get a more minimalistic look. By removing excess furniture and having floor space, it allows us to now clean up more quickly. Not only is it a new space, where I enjoy the open floor plan, but I really enjoy having less stuff in the room. I feel like a burden has been lifted off us and it seems much more peaceful to enjoy. As I look around there is less to clean around and more space to just have fun with the kids and not have it feel so cramped because of the stuff we owned. One of the bigger changes we made during this time was to not keep any toys in the upstairs living room. That doesn‚Äôt mean the kids don‚Äôt bring their toys there to play or use the dining room table to draw, color, or play with play-doh on. It really just meant that we didn‚Äôt want that stuff to be stored in the living room as we found before that led to creating more mess. To accomplish this, we made sure those items previously stored in the living room that the kids wanted to keep had a place in their bedrooms or the toy room downstairs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Before:</strong></p>\n\n<!-- wp:gallery {\"ids\":[51122131,51122130,51122129],\"columns\":3,\"linkTo\":\"attachment\"} -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-3 is-cropped\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/00d146544a.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"51122131\" class=\"wp-image-51122131\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/fd10a654e9.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"51122130\" class=\"wp-image-51122130\"/></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/69370fd6e8.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"51122129\" class=\"wp-image-51122129\"/></figure></li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:gallery -->\n\n<p><strong>After:</strong></p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/68d5d1d465.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"188\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<p>As you can tell we couldn‚Äôt be happier with the space and are looking forward to enjoying it for years to come. Even though the remodel was a big project in itself, I feel a great side effect of it was that we were able to pack everything away and then Intentionally choose what to bring back into our living space.</p>\n\n<p>Once we had our living space set up as we liked it and brought back the items we felt were a good fit in our life, we donated the rest. This is another crucial step as you don‚Äôt want to be hanging on to boxes or stuff in another place of the house. I understand that you might not want to get rid of those items right away and if that is you, I would suggest you set a calendar reminder to find that box(es) buried in the garage that you need to donate at a specific date in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Have you had a housing remodel or project in the past and found it a good time to declutter items? If so I would love to hear how it went for you and if you think it was successful. If not and you have a project on the horizon let me know about it and share your success after it is all done.</p>\n",

Decluttering your house is not an easy feat unless you are just moving from college and haven&rsquo;t acquired anything. We got derailed this past year with the kitchen remodel but in a way that helped us declutter all of those rooms affected. The one thing if you move from room to room like my wife and I are doing you need to make sure you don&rsquo;t just go dump things back in a room you have already cleared out. However, that is one of the hardest things so when you get down to only a couple rooms left (like we are now) it gets harder and harder to get it to what you want. However, I am looking forward to the challenge this fall again as the seasons are changing.</p>\n<p>If this is something that interest you and you have been wanting to get rid of a lot of stuff I would suggest that you check out what Anthony Ongaro is doing over at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Break The Twitch<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.

Almost has a calming effect.*  \n\nA year later and we have still been working on the other rooms of our house but it is something that takes time. Decluttering your house is not an easy feat unless you are just moving from college and haven't acquired anything. We got derailed this past year with the kitchen remodel but in a way that helped us declutter all of those rooms affected. The one thing if you move from room to room like my wife and I are doing you need to make sure you don't just go dump things back in a room you have already cleared out. However, that is one of the hardest things so when you get down to only a couple rooms left (like we are now) it gets harder and harder to get it to what you want. However, I am looking forward to the challenge this fall again as the seasons are changing.  \n\nIf this is something that interest you and you have been wanting to get rid of a lot of stuff I would suggest that you check out what Anthony Ongaro is doing over at <a href=\"http://breakthetwitch.com\">Break The Twitch</a>. In fact, the video below is a good way to get started with the 6 most Popular Methods.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aeK8Y2W-z6M\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>  \n*via <a href=\"http://www.breakthetwitch.com/decluttering-methods/\">6 Popular Minimalist Decluttering Methods</a> on Break the Twitch.*\n\nAnother good resource and guide is <a href=\"https://groomandstyle.com/art-tidying-up-complete-guide-decluttered-life/\">\"The Art of Tidying Up: A Complete Guide to a Decluttered Life\"</a> by Rebecca Moses\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2022/0dc5054d08.jpg\" alt=\"The art of tidying up 1024x525\" title=\"the-art-of-tidying-up-1024x525.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"307\" />  \n\n***Do you use Fall or a change in seasons as a good time to clean up or clean out around the house? If so what is your best method of doing so or how do you approach it?***\n",

Let's just say it was good for me that it was a short story. The main topic of the book is around discrimination but is set in a more future state.

I am going to guess it wouldn't as it never interested me much back then but if I was better in those areas it might change the overall trajectory of my life... Well, that is a good question and one I will never know.\n\nHowever, I look at the education that my kids are receiving and I know it is really good but could it be better if they were challenged every step of the way or at least pushed to master the subjects they were being taught before they move to the next grade? It would take a great under haul of our current education system in order to get to the perfect place that Sal Khan describes, however maybe the education system we have today should take more steps to move us closer in that direction so we can at least narrow the gap.\n\n**What are your thoughts? Do you think making people masters in all core subjects would be a good thing or a bad thing?**\n",

Not to mention Mattermark the company is doing some pretty cool things on top of this daily newsletter.</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://contest.inside.com/giveaways/amazon-echo-giveaway/?lucky=152\">Inside Daily Brief</a>¬†(side note you can win an Amazon Echo if you sign) - Now this one is super new for me but I have been subscribed since they started. ¬†I will say it has been changing a lot since it started as it is trying to get formatting, content type, and other things ironed out. ¬†However, one thing is for sure they have some great summaries of top news stories of the day. ¬†Not sure if the trend will continue but earlier on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jason\">Jason Calacanis</a> was sending out a shared Google Doc to twitter for everyone to come help make suggestions before the next Daily Brief was published. ¬†I can't wait to see how this one continues to evolve and wish the team the best.</li>\n</ul>\nEach of them provides something different which is why for me I can see them lasting in my routine for a while.\n\nFinal side note on News apps, I installed NextDraft app on my phone but never really use it¬†because the email is so perfect for my routine as it is in a place I already look and can access it anywhere.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on News Apps and do you think one will really stick around? ¬†If you are a frequent user of one let me know what your favorite one is as I am always game to try new apps.\n",

				"title": "\"Uncommon Stock: Exit Strategy\" by Eliot Peper",
				"content_html": "<p>The final book in the Uncommon Stock series hit the shelves on July 29, 2015 and if you were like me you had already pre-ordered it so it would be instantly sent to your Kindle.  ¬†</p>\n<p>If¬†you missed the launch of the Part III, don&rsquo;t worry you can pick it up from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Amazon for only $4.99<!-- raw HTML omitted -->¬†(it is a steal).  ¬†</p>\n<p>Trust me you will not be disappointed with Part III, just as the first two¬†books were¬†well worth it. ¬†Now if you haven&rsquo;t read them yet I would suggest you read all three in order (here is my take on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Part II, Uncommon Stock: Power Play<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>\n<p>I was really excited to see how the whole journey of Mara and James unfolded in this book and it was too perfect that it hit the shelves right before I had a long trip to China. ¬†I started reading it on my long flights and wished I wouldn&rsquo;t have had other things that kept distracting me along the way.</p>\n<p>However, since the team I was with never went into work until 8am I had plenty of time after waking up at 4am, as I wasn&rsquo;t able to sleep any longer, to continue reading. ¬†The only bad part about that was I didn&rsquo;t want to put it down when I knew it was time to catch the cab. ¬†Also, it helped that domestic flights in China seem to be delayed often which allowed me to finish the book and write this posting.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>Now onto Exit¬†Strategy, the story puts you right back into the fast-paced life of the Mozaik startup roller coaster. ¬†</p>\n<p>Eliot does a great job keeping your thoughts focused on wondering what Mara is going to do next and how are they ever going to take down Maelstrom. ¬†Not to mention you are captivated by the¬†underlying story about Mozaik, the company you have been rooting for since Part 1. ¬†He does a great job walking you through some of the real-life examples of the pains that Startups go through from the¬†beginning¬†all the way through IPOs. ¬†Honestly, this is one of those books that touches on so many topics that it probably¬†appeals¬†to people that like all kinds of books from mystery, suspense and action.

				"content_text": "The final book in the Uncommon Stock series hit the shelves on July 29, 2015 and if you were like me you had already pre-ordered it so it would be instantly sent to your Kindle.  ¬†\n\nIf¬†you missed the launch of the Part III, don't worry you can pick it up from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Uncommon-Stock-Exit-Strategy-Book-ebook/dp/B0116B9ILS/?tag=stthink-20\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon for only $4.99</a>¬†(it is a steal).  ¬†\n\nTrust me you will not be disappointed with Part III, just as the first two¬†books were¬†well worth it. ¬†Now if you haven't read them yet I would suggest you read all three in order (here is my take on <a href=\"https://ericmwalk.blog/2015/03/18/uncommon-stock-power.html\">Part II, Uncommon Stock: Power Play</a>).  \n\nI was really excited to see how the whole journey of Mara and James unfolded in this book and it was too perfect that it hit the shelves right before I had a long trip to China. ¬†I started reading it on my long flights and wished I wouldn't have had other things that kept distracting me along the way.  \n\nHowever, since the team I was with never went into work until 8am I had plenty of time after waking up at 4am, as I wasn't able to sleep any longer, to continue reading. ¬†The only bad part about that was I didn't want to put it down when I knew it was time to catch the cab. ¬†Also, it helped that domestic flights in China seem to be delayed often which allowed me to finish the book and write this posting.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Uncommon-Stock-Exit-Strategy-Book-ebook/dp/B0116B9ILS/?tag=stthink-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-51118258\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/f0989fe441.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"480\"  alt=\"\"/></a>\n\nNow onto Exit¬†Strategy, the story puts you right back into the fast-paced life of the Mozaik startup roller coaster. ¬† \n\nEliot does a great job keeping your thoughts focused on wondering what Mara is going to do next and how are they ever going to take down Maelstrom. ¬†Not to mention you are captivated by the¬†underlying story about Mozaik, the company you have been rooting for since Part 1. ¬†He does a great job walking you through some of the real-life examples of the pains that Startups go through from the¬†beginning¬†all the way through IPOs. ¬†Honestly, this is one of those books that touches on so many topics that it probably¬†appeals¬†to people that like all kinds of books from mystery, suspense and action. Then to top that off it is about this Startup company trying to catch people involved in financial fraud, murder, and deception.  \n\nNow I could probably write on and on about what happened but that would just ruin the fun of reading it. ¬†So I will at least give you a couple of my favorite quotes/sayings from the book that stuck out to me. ¬†I think each of these just go to show the amount of information beyond being a good story is packed into this book and more specifically this series.\n\n>The short version is that when you lay good code on top of bad code, the result is still bad code.\n\n>You can't¬†wait until you had enough time for exercise.

Otherwise, you will end up installing one that wasn't the same color (Yes this happened to me see below).</li>\n\t<li>Buy the right trowel for the size of tile you are using and then make sure you don't use too much mortar. ¬†Especially, be careful on the small tiles as I spent a lot of time in the back end trying to scrape it out of the joints so my grout would fill it later.</li>\n\t<li>You will run into more¬†problems than you anticipated and are going to start replacing a lot more things (e.g., Pipes, Sub-floor, Walls).</li>\n\t<li>Did I mention that you should overbuy things at your Home¬†Improvement Store</li>\n\t<li>Realize that as you are going to get sidetracked by your¬†significant other to¬†complete \"Fluff\" projects some of which are¬†unrelated to the task at hand.</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/30906/2021/8fcb1f033a.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" alt=\"\" />\n\n¬†\n",
